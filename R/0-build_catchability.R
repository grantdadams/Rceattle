#' Catchability specification
#'
#' @description
#' Carry environmental linkages on survey/index catchability `q`. The effect of
#' an `env_data` covariate is written as a formula and can carry priors, bounds,
#' and an estimation phase like any other linkage.
#'
#' @param linkages Optional named list of [linkage_spec()] objects keyed by
#'   catchability parameter. The only parameter is `q`. Coefficients are per
#'   fleet by default (`by = ~ fleet`); use the `fleet` argument of
#'   [linkage_spec()] to restrict a spec to particular fleets.
#'
#' @return A list of catchability settings for [fit_mod()].
#'
#' @examples
#' \donttest{
#' # One temperature effect on q per fleet. `by = ~ fleet` is the default, and a
#' # fleet without an estimated survey catchability is not linkable, so at fit time
#' # restrict the linkage to the estimated-q fleets (here fleet 7 of BS2017SS).
#' build_catchability(linkages = list(
#'   q = linkage_spec(~ temp, fleet = 7)))

# Catchability forms that do NOT estimate q, so a q linkage must not attach:
# "Fixed" holds index_log_q at its input (a linkage would silently turn a fixed
# q time-varying, contrary to the assessor's Fixed setting), and
# "Analytical"/"AnalyticalArith" solve q from the data (index_log_q is mapped
# out, so a linkage targets a non-free parameter and does nothing). Both are
# rejected up front rather than quietly changing q. See build_map_catchability.

# A second, different reason to refuse a q linkage. "Environmental" and "AR1" DO
# estimate q, but they rebuild index_q from their own formula in the cpp,
# assigning over the value that carries q_linkage_offset rather than adding to
# it. The linkage is then accepted, REPORTed in q_linkage_offset as a live
# covariate effect, and never enters the likelihood -- beta_linkage is left free
# with an identically-zero gradient. Refuse it, and point at the linkage
# equivalent: these two forms exist to be replaced by exactly that grammar, so a
# user reaching for both wants the linkage on its own.
