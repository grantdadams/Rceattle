#' Process residuals for an Rceattle model's random-effect processes
#'
#' @description
#' One-sample process residuals for the model's random-effect (or penalized)
#' process deviations, in the style of SAM's `procres()` (Nielsen and Berg
#' 2014). They validate the *process* model -- whether the deviations behave like
#' their assumed iid normal process -- a complement to the observation-based
#' [osa_residuals()].
#'
#' Each set of deviations carries a Gaussian process prior in the model. The
#' posterior *mode* of the deviations is shrunk toward that prior, so -- following
#' SAM -- a single draw is taken from the joint posterior of the deviations (from
#' the joint precision when they are random effects, or the fixed-effect
#' covariance when they are penalized fixed effects) and standardized by the
#' process standard deviation. Under a correctly specified process these are
#' approximately iid N(0, 1). Because a random draw is used the residuals are
#' stochastic; set `seed` for reproducibility.
#'
#' Supported processes and their deviations:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{`"recruitment"`}{`rec_dev`, prior `N(-bias_adjust_proc * R_sd^2/2, R_sd^2)` per species.}
#'   \item{`"initial"`}{`init_dev`, prior `N(-bias_adjust_proc * R_sd^2/2, R_sd^2)` per species.}
#'   \item{`"catchability"`}{`index_q_dev`, prior `N(0, q_dev_sd^2)` per index.}
#' }
#' `"all"` returns every supported process present in the fit. Selectivity and
#' natural-mortality deviations (which use random-walk / 2D-AR1 priors) are not
#' yet supported. Recruitment and initial-abundance residuals are exact (their
#' priors are iid). Catchability residuals are exact only for the iid deviate
#' prior (`Time_varying_q = 1` or `2`); for a random-walk or AR1 catchability
#' prior the marginal-SD standardization ignores the prior correlation, so those
#' residuals are approximate and a warning is emitted.
#'
#' @param object A fitted `Rceattle` model. The targeted deviations must be estimated -- as random effects (e.g. `random_rec = TRUE`) or as penalized fixed effects -- with a usable covariance.
#' @param fit deprecated name for `object`, still accepted so existing
#'   scripts keep working. Supplying both is an error.
#' @param process One of `"recruitment"`, `"initial"`, `"catchability"`, or
#'   `"all"`.
#' @param seed Seed for the posterior draw. Default 123.
#'
#' @return A data frame of class `rceattle_osa` (so it can be passed to
#'   [osa_diagnostics()] and [plot.rceattle_osa()]) with one row per deviation:
#'   columns `source` (the process), `fleet`, `species`, `year`,
#'   `age_length_bin`, and `residual`.

  # Refused on a DSEM for "recruitment" and "initial" only -- "catchability" is
  # untouched by one and must stay available. Two different reasons:
  #
  #   recruitment: not computable at all. rec_dev is mapped out under a DSEM
  #     (fit_mod() maps it out because the template overwrites it from the
  #     latent states), so it is in neither the joint precision nor cov.fixed
  #     and there is no posterior to draw from. This is true for an IID sem too,
  #     so it is not a question of narrowing the guard to structured sems.
  #   initial: computable and SILENTLY WRONG. init_dev IS estimated under a
  #     DSEM, and its density uses the DSEM-derived R_sd -- but the prior read
  #     here comes from exp(R_log_sd), which under a DSEM is the mapped-out
  #     placeholder rather than the SD the density used. Measured on BS2017SS:
  #     0.7071 against the 0.9888/1.3321/0.7976 actually in force, a 28%/47%/-11%
  #     error in the residual scale, returning plausible-looking numbers.
  #
  # Standardizing the recruitment deviations properly would need the GMRF's own
  # Cholesky factor rather than a scalar SD per year.
