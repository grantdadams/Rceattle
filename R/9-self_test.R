#' Self-test simulation analysis
#'
#' @description Simulates data from an Rceattle model and refits the model to the simulated data, to check that the fitting procedure recovers the operating-model parameters. TODO add process variation (i.e. random recruitment deviations) to the simulation.
#'
#' @inheritParams rceattle-refit-args
#' @param seed random number seed. Each simulation \code{i} uses \code{seed + i}
#'   so results are reproducible under both sequential and parallel execution.
#' @param nsim number of simulations
#' @param simulate passed to \code{\link{sim_mod}}. If \code{TRUE} (default),
#'   data are simulated with observation error; if \code{FALSE}, expected
#'   values from the model are used.
#' @param getsd whether each refit runs \code{TMB::sdreport}. Self-test compares
#'   the refit point estimates to the operating model, so \code{FALSE} is faster
#'   with no effect on that comparison. Default \code{NULL} inherits the input
#'   model's setting (\code{TRUE} only if it carries an \code{sdrep}).
#' @param phase as in \code{\link{fit_mod}}. Under the default
#'   \code{start = "initial"} each refit covers the same ground the original fit
#'   did, so a model that needed phasing to fit its real data needs it again for
#'   every simulated one -- without it such a model's refits can end many orders
#'   of magnitude from a zero gradient and be dropped as non-converged. Default
#'   \code{NULL} reads the setting \code{fit_mod()} recorded on the source fit
#'   (\code{fit$run_config$fit_control$phase}), so a model fitted under the
#'   package default of \code{phase = FALSE} is refitted unphased; pass
#'   \code{TRUE} for a model that needs phasing but was not fitted with it.
#' @param start which of the input model's parameter sets each refit starts
#'   from. \code{"initial"} (default) uses \code{initial_params}, the values the
#'   original fit itself started from, so the estimator has to travel the same
#'   distance to the optimum on simulated data that it did on the real data.
#'   \code{"estimated"} starts from \code{estimated_params} instead: much faster
#'   and far more likely to converge, but the fixed effects -- and, with
#'   \code{random_rec = TRUE}, the inner Laplace problem too -- begin at the
#'   generating values, so on a multimodal or weakly identified surface the
#'   optimizer never leaves the basin containing them and recovery is close to
#'   guaranteed by construction. Read it as optimistic about recovery, not
#'   merely less powerful. (Nor is it a complete warm start: \code{fit_mod()}
#'   resets \code{log_Ftarget}, \code{proj_F_prop}, and the stock-recruit
#'   \eqn{\alpha}/\eqn{\beta} from the model's own specification under either
#'   setting.) Non-identifiability shows up in the curvature and so is visible
#'   either way -- via \code{$convergence}'s Hessian conditioning and
#'   estimability checks -- it is \emph{reachability} that a warm start stops
#'   testing.
#' @param debug return every simulation rather than the converged ones. The
#'   dropped runs are the interesting ones when a self-test comes back short, and
#'   each carries its own \code{$convergence} diagnostics. See \strong{Value}.
#' @param timeout elapsed-second limit per simulation, \code{Inf} (default) for
#'   none. The optimizer runs with no iteration cap, so a replicate that wanders
#'   somewhere pathological can stall the whole run -- a hang that no convergence
#'   check can catch, because the fit never returns. One that exceeds the limit
#'   is stopped, counted as non-converged and reported separately. Approximate:
#'   the limit is checked when control returns to R, so it fires between the
#'   optimizer's function evaluations rather than inside one.
#' @param process passed to \code{\link{sim_mod}}. \code{FALSE} (default) keeps
#'   the fitted process deviations, so the test measures whether the estimator
#'   recovers its own parameters from new observations. Naming a process --
#'   \code{"recruitment"}, \code{"M"}, \code{"growth"}, \code{"dynamics"},
#'   \code{TRUE}, ... -- redraws it too, so the test instead measures whether the
#'   estimator recovers a process it has not been shown. The deviations behind
#'   each replicate come back in \code{attr(result, "process_sim")}; see
#'   \code{Value}.
#'
#' @return A list of Rceattle models named \code{Sim_1}, \code{Sim_2}, ....
#'   By default only the converged simulations, renumbered contiguously; a
#'   message reports how many were dropped.
#'
#'   The list carries class \code{"Rceattle_selftest"} and the number of
#'   simulations attempted in \code{attr(, "nsim")}, so printing it reports the
#'   convergence rate; see \code{\link{print.Rceattle_selftest}}. It is
#'   otherwise the list it always was -- \code{sims[["Sim_1"]]},
#'   \code{length(sims)}, \code{lapply()} and
#'   \code{plot_biomass(c(sims, list(fit)))} are all unchanged, and \code{c()}
#'   and \code{[} return a plain list of fits.
#'
#'   With \code{debug = TRUE}, every simulation, with \code{Sim_i} being
#'   simulation \code{i} (so it pairs with the seed \code{seed + i}), and a
#'   logical vector of the convergence verdicts in \code{attr(, "converged")}.
#'   Inspect a failure with \code{sims[[j]]$convergence}. A simulation whose
#'   refit errored outright is returned as the condition object rather than a
#'   model, so it cannot abort the run.
#'
#'   When \code{process} redrew something, \code{attr(, "process_sim")} holds the
#'   deviations that generated each replicate's data -- a list keyed by the same
#'   \code{Sim_i} names, so \code{attr(x, "process_sim")[["Sim_1"]]} belongs to
#'   \code{x[["Sim_1"]]}, subset and renumbered alongside the models. Each entry
#'   is a named list of whichever of \code{rec_dev}, \code{init_dev},
#'   \code{log_M1_dev} and \code{beta_linkage_re} were drawn, each with a
#'   same-shaped \code{_drawn} logical marking the cells the draw touched --
#'   restrict any recovery statistic to those, since the rest are fitted values
#'   (see \code{\link{sim_mod}}). Compare estimates against these, not against
#'   the operating model: its fitted deviations are no longer what generated the
#'   data.
#'
#' @section Interpreting the spread:
#' \code{\link{sim_mod}} redraws the observations only -- indices, catch,
#' compositions, CAAL and stomach contents. Some rows are deliberately left
#' alone, and \code{\link{sim_mod}} warns about each: a predator whose
#' suitability is empirical rather than estimated has no predicted diet to draw
#' from, and a covariance (MVN/MVNORM) survey fleet has no covariance outside
#' the years it is fitted to. Those data are held fixed across every replicate,
#' so recovery of whatever they inform is optimistic.
#'
#' By default it does not redraw recruitment, so with
#' \code{random_rec = TRUE} every replicate shares the operating model's single
#' recruitment realization, and that realization is its shrunk empirical-Bayes
#' modes rather than a draw from N(0, sigmaR). Two consequences: the spread
#' across replicates carries observation error only and is a lower bound on
#' estimation uncertainty in SSB and recruitment (do not read it against the
#' model's own uncertainty bands, which include process error); and sigmaR is
#' re-estimated from deviations that were shrunk toward zero the same way in
#' every replicate, a downward bias that averaging over simulations does not
#' remove. Pass \code{process = "recruitment"} (or \code{"dynamics"}, or
#' \code{TRUE}) to redraw it and remove both, at the cost of asking a different
#' question -- see \code{process} above.

#' Print method for a self-test
#'
#' @description Reports what a self-test is run to find out: how many
#' simulations the estimator brought back to an optimum, and under what the
#' replicates were generated. The returned list cannot say the first on its own
#' -- non-converged runs are dropped before it is returned, so the number of
#' fits returned is not the number attempted.
#'
#' @details
#' The status is the convergence RATE, since that is the quantity the run
#' produces: `FAIL` if nothing converged, `WARN` below `rate`, `NOTE` if any
#' replicate was dropped, `OK` otherwise. The table beneath tallies each
#' returned fit's own `$convergence$status`, which is a separate question --
#' a replicate can reach a zero gradient and still carry a `NOTE` or `WARN` --
#' and those are not folded into the header for that reason.
#'
#' The last line says what generated the replicates, because it decides what the
#' spread means. With processes held fixed (the default) `sim_mod()` redraws the
#' observations alone, so the spread carries observation error only and is a
#' lower bound on estimation uncertainty -- do not read it against the model's
