#' Iteratively reweight composition data (McAllister-Ianelli)
#'
#' @description
#' Tunes multinomial composition weights by refitting: each pass sets a fleet's
#' weight to the McAllister & Ianelli (1997) weight implied by the previous fit,
#' and stops once the weights settle. The weight multiplies the input sample
#' size, so changing it changes the fit and hence the next implied weight --
#' which is why the weights are tuned iteratively rather than in one step.
#'
#' @details
#' Only multinomial fleets are tuned. A Dirichlet-multinomial fleet estimates
#' its own weight within the likelihood, so tuning it externally would compete
#' with that estimate; those fleets are named and skipped, as are any requested
#' through `fleets` that have no fitted composition data.
#'
#' Tuning stops when the largest relative change in any weight falls below
#' `tol`. Hitting `n_iter` first gives a warning, not an error -- the partly
#' tuned fit is returned either way, and `$reweight$history` shows whether the
#' weights were still settling.
#'
#' The weight is a parameter, not a data input, so each pass carries it to the
#' next through `inits`; `fleet_control$Comp_weights` supplies the value only
#' when a model is built from scratch. Editing that column and refitting from
#' an existing fit therefore has no effect. The tuned weights are written back
#' to it so that saving the data and rebuilding reproduces the tuned model.
#'
#' @param fit A fitted `Rceattle` model, fitted with `estimateMode` 0 or 1.
#' @param n_iter Maximum number of iterations (default 10).
#' @param tol Relative change in the weights below which to stop (default 0.01).
#' @param fleets Fleet codes to tune. Default `NULL` tunes every eligible fleet.
#' @param verbose Print the weights each iteration (default `TRUE`).
#'
#' @return The model refitted with the final weights, carrying a `reweight`
#'   element: `history` (one row per fleet per iteration), `iterations`, and
#'   `converged`. The last rows of `history` are the weights the returned model
#'   was fitted with.
