# Renamed-argument support
#
# The diagnostics used six different names for the same thing -- the fitted
# model they operate on (`Rceattle`, `fit`, `object`, ...). They now all take
# `object`. The old spelling is still accepted, so every existing assessment
# script keeps running unchanged.
#
# The old name is declared LAST in each signature, so a positional call such as
# `retrospective(ss_run, peels = 10)` still binds the model to `object`. The old
# name can therefore only be supplied by name, which is how the scripts in
# ../Rceattle-models and ../GOA-ATF-ESP already write it. An abbreviation of the
# old name (`osa_residuals(fi = m)`) is not supported -- it never was, for the
# functions that take `...`.
#
# BOTH formals must carry a default. `retrospective()`, `jitter()` and
# `self_test()` export the caller's frame to PSOCK workers with
# `parallel::clusterExport(cl, ls(envir = export_env), export_env)`, and `ls()`
# on a function frame lists formals that were never supplied. A formal with no
# default therefore makes `clusterExport()` throw "argument is missing", which
# `.parallel_lapply()` catches -- so every peel, jitter and self-test would
# silently drop to serial on Windows while reporting a memory problem. FORK
# (macOS/Linux) skips clusterExport entirely and would never show it.

#' Should a renamed argument warn?
#'
#' @description
#' One switch for the whole package. The old argument names are accepted
#' SILENTLY: a release that renames nothing a user can see should not start
#' printing warnings inside long assessment and MSE loops.
#' `options(Rceattle.warn_deprecated_args = TRUE)` turns them on for a session.
#' Turning them on for everyone is one edit here rather than ten at the call
#' sites -- a deliberate release decision, not yet taken.
#'
#' @return `TRUE` if deprecated argument names should warn, otherwise `FALSE`.
#' @keywords internal
#' @noRd

#' Resolve a renamed argument
#'
#' @description
#' Called only when the caller supplied the deprecated name. Returns the value
#' to use for the new argument.
#'
#' Supplying both names is an error rather than a silent preference: the two
#' would have to be the same fitted model for the call to mean anything, and
#' guessing which one the user meant is exactly the kind of assumption that
#' produces a plausible wrong answer.
#'
#' @param old value bound to the deprecated argument name.
#' @param new_supplied `TRUE` if the caller also gave the current name. Pass
#'   `!missing(<new>)`, not `!is.null(<new>)` -- an explicit
#'   `object = NULL` alongside the old name is still two spellings of one
#'   argument, and should be rejected rather than quietly resolved.
#' @param old_name,new_name the two spellings, for the message.
#' @param fn calling function, for the message.
#'
#' @return `old`, the value supplied under the deprecated name.
