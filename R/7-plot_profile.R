# Likelihood-profile figures
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The component profile is a conflict diagnostic, not a precision one. The total
# alone answers "how well is this parameter determined"; the components answer
# "do the data sources agree about where it should be", and a smooth quadratic
# total can hide two of them pulling in opposite directions.
#
# Layout follows r4ss::SSplotProfile(), which is what most readers of a US
# federal assessment document will have seen: change in negative log-likelihood
# on the y axis, each series re-zeroed at its own minimum, small components
# filtered out, and the total drawn heavier than the rest.

#' Plot the likelihood components across a profile
#'
#' @description Draws each negative log-likelihood component against the
#'   profiled parameter, with the total overlaid, in the style of
#'   `r4ss::SSplotProfile()`. Where the curves disagree about which value of the
#'   parameter they prefer, the data sources are in conflict -- which is what
#'   the total on its own cannot show.
#'
#' @details
#' Read the figure by where each curve bottoms out, not by how deep it is. Every
#' series is re-zeroed at its own minimum (`relative = "own"`) and a point marks
#' that minimum, so the spread of the points along the x axis *is* the
#' disagreement: components whose points sit together support the same value,
#' and a component whose point sits far from the total's is pulling against the
#' rest.
#'
#' When one component dwarfs the others it sets the y axis and the rest flatten
#' onto the bottom, so where *they* prefer the parameter cannot be read.
#' `relative = "scaled"` puts every curve on 0 to 1 so the minima can be
#' compared. It discards magnitude — a component moving 0.02 draws like one
#' moving 40 — so raise `minfraction` with it. That filter runs on the raw
#' change, and is what keeps a barely-constrained component from drawing a
#' confident-looking curve.
#'
#' `relative = "minimum"` re-zeroes every series at the total's minimum, showing
#' what each component gives up by moving away from the fitted value.
#'
#' Under `joint = "multiply"` or `"add"` a dotted vertical line marks the fitted
#' model (a multiplier of 1, an offset of 0).
#'
#' The total is drawn in black, heavier than the components, and is kept out of
#' the colour legend so the palette separates only the components being
#' compared. Components whose change over the grid is under `minfraction` of the
#' total's are dropped: they are flat on this scale and would only crowd the
#' legend. Non-converged grid points leave a gap in the curve.
#'
#' `line_col`, `lwd` and `lty` apply to the **components**. The total is drawn
#' solid and black at 1.6 times `lwd`, so that it stays the reference line
#' whatever the components are styled as. Series are ordered, in the legend and
#' in the palette, by how much each moves over the grid.
#'
#' Under `random_rec = TRUE` the total is the Laplace-approximated marginal
#' likelihood while the components are the inner joint negative
#' log-likelihood, so they will not sum; [profile_components()] says so when
#' they differ. The shapes are still comparable.
#'
#' @param Rceattle_profile A single `"Rceattle_profile"` from
#'   [profile.Rceattle()], or a list of them to compare models in facets (e.g.
#'   the same profile run on two model configurations).
#' @param weighted,relative,minfraction Passed to [profile_components()].
#'   `minfraction` defaults to `0.01` here, as in `r4ss::SSplotProfile()`.
#' @param add_cutoff Draw a horizontal line at `cutoff`. Off by default: the
#'   cutoff is a statement about the total, and drawing it across the
#'   components invites reading it as one about them.
#' @param cutoff Height of that line. Default `1.92`, the 95%
#'   profile-likelihood cutoff for one parameter, \eqn{\chi^2_1(0.95)/2}.
#' @param xlab X-axis label. Default names the profiled parameter and cell in
#'   the units the grid is in.
#' @param ylab Y-axis label. Default follows `relative`.
#' @inheritParams rceattle-plot-args
#'
#' @return A `ggplot` object. Its `$data` is the plotted frame, so the numbers
#'   behind the figure can be read back off it.
#'
#' @seealso [profile_components()] for the same numbers as a data frame,
#'   [profile.Rceattle()] to run the profile, [print.Rceattle_profile()] for
#'   whether the grid brackets the minimum.
