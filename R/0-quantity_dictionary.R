#' Quantity dictionary: report name -> meaning, units, dimensions
#'
#' @description
#' `fit$quantities` holds every derived quantity the TMB model reports, under
#' the model's own abbreviated names (`ssb`, `F_spp`, `NByageF`, ...). This
#' table is the single place saying what each one is, the units it is in, how it
#' is shaped, whether it carries a standard error, and what the same quantity is
#' called in the NOAA standardized assessment output.
#'
#' Columns:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{quantity}{Name in `fit$quantities`.}
#'   \item{process}{Which part of the model it belongs to. One of
#'     "population", "recruitment", "mortality", "fishing", "reference_points",
#'     "catchability", "selectivity", "growth", "composition", "predation",
#'     "likelihood", "linkage", "internal".}
#'   \item{meaning}{One sentence a fisheries scientist can act on.}
#'   \item{units}{The units the value is in, or "unitless" / "proportion".}
#'   \item{dims}{Dimensions, in the model's own notation.}
#'   \item{se}{Whether [TMB::sdreport()] gives a standard error for it, i.e.
#'     whether the template `ADREPORT`s it. `FALSE` means `fit$sdrep` carries
#'     nothing for this quantity and any interval must come from elsewhere.}
#'   \item{standard_label}{The `label` this quantity takes in the NOAA
#'     standardized assessment output consumed by `stockplotr` and `asar`, or
#'     `NA` where that standard has no equivalent.}
#' }
#'
#' Units follow the model throughout: numbers-at-age are **thousands of fish**
#' and weight-at-age is **kg**, so their product is **mt**; see the
#' `Observation_units` column in `R/0-column_schema.R`.

#' Look up what a CEATTLE reported quantity is
#'
#' `fit$quantities` uses the model's own abbreviated names. This returns the
#' table mapping each one to what it means, the units it is in, how it is
#' shaped, whether it carries a standard error, and what the same quantity is
#' called in the NOAA standardized assessment output.
#'
#' @param quantity Report names as they appear in `names(fit$quantities)`,
#'   default `NULL` for every documented quantity.
#' @param process Character vector restricting the table to one or more parts of
#'   the model: `"population"`, `"recruitment"`, `"mortality"`, `"fishing"`,
#'   `"reference_points"`, `"catchability"`, `"selectivity"`, `"growth"`,
#'   `"composition"`, `"predation"`, `"likelihood"`, `"linkage"` or
#'   `"internal"`.
#'
#' @return A data frame with one row per quantity and columns `quantity`,
#'   `process`, `meaning`, `units`, `dims`, `se` and `standard_label`.
#'
#' @details
#' Units follow the model throughout: numbers-at-age are **thousands of fish**
#' and weight-at-age is **kg**, so their product is **mt**. A quantity whose
#' units read `"mt or thousands of fish"` follows its fleet's
#' `Observation_units` column.
#'
#' `se = TRUE` means the TMB template `ADREPORT`s the quantity, so `fit$sdrep`
#' carries a standard error for it and [as.data.frame.Rceattle()] can fill `se`,
#' `lwr` and `upr`. `se = FALSE` means no standard error exists anywhere on the
#' fit for that quantity. Nothing has a standard error when the fit was produced
#' with `fit_control(getsd = FALSE)`, which leaves `sdrep` NULL.
#'
#' `standard_label` gives the name the quantity takes in the NOAA standardized
#' assessment output that `stockplotr` and `asar` consume, so a table can be
#' relabelled for those tools; `NA` marks a quantity that standard has no
#' equivalent for. Rceattle's own names are kept as the primary vocabulary
#' because several quantities (predation, multispecies) have no standard name.
#'
#' Every per-recruit reference point (`SPR0`, `SPRlimit`, `SPRtarget`,
#' `SPRFinit`, `NbyageSPR`) is computed only under `msmMode = 0` and is exactly
#' **zero on a multispecies fit** -- M there carries predation mortality, which
#' scales with predator abundance, so spawning output per recruit is not a
#' property of the prey stock alone.
