#' Forecast skill across retrospective peels
#'
#' Scores how well each retrospective peel's projection recovers the full
#' time-series model's estimate over the years the peel did not see, given the
#' known catch. The full model is taken as the best available estimate of what
#' happened, so this measures forecast skill rather than the estimation
#' consistency [retrospective()] reports through Mohn's rho.
#'
#' @details
#' Each peel drops the last `i` years of data, refits, and then solves fishing
#' mortality against the catch that was actually taken in those years -- so the
#' projection differs from the full model only in what it could not know:
#' the recruitment, and anything downstream of it. That makes this the natural
#' comparison for recruitment-projection assumptions, e.g.
#' `proj_mean_rec = TRUE` against `FALSE` against a DSEM.
#'
#' Skill is reported as the mean absolute scaled error (MASE), following the
#' hindcast cross-validation of Kell et al. (2016) but scored against the full
#' model's estimate rather than against held-out observations:
#'
#' \deqn{MASE = \frac{\overline{|forecast - reference|}}{\overline{|naive - reference|}}}
#'
#' The naive forecast is the peel's own terminal estimate carried forward,
#' i.e. "assume nothing changes". So:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item `MASE < 1` -- the projection beats assuming no change.
#'   \item `MASE > 1` -- it is worse than assuming no change, which usually means
#'     the recruitment assumption is pulling the projection the wrong way.
#'   \item `MASE = 1` -- no better than persistence.
#' }
#'
#' A MASE is undefined when the naive forecast happens to be exactly right
#' (a zero denominator); those rows come back `NA` rather than `Inf`.
#'
#' Read short horizons with care. At `years_ahead = 1` the denominator is a
#' single \eqn{|naive - reference|}, so a peel whose persistence forecast lands
#' close to the reference by chance produces a very large MASE that says more
#' about the denominator than about the projection -- values in the tens appear
#' routinely at one-year horizons and settle by three. Compare the deeper peels,
#' or the median across peels, rather than any single number. This is a property
#' of the scaling, not of the model, and it is shared with the `ss3diags`
#' implementation the definition matches.
#'
#' @param object A fitted Rceattle model (the full time series).
#' @param peels Number of peels. Passed to [retrospective()].
#' @param quantity Quantities to score against the full model. Any of `"ssb"`,
#'   `"biomass"`, `"R"`. Ignored when `reference = "observed"`.
#' @param reference What to score the projection against.
#'   `"model"` (default) compares each peel's projection to the full time-series
#'   model's estimate, taking that as the best available account of what
#'   happened. `"observed"` is classic hindcast cross-validation: it compares the
#'   peel's PREDICTED SURVEY INDEX to the index values actually observed in the
#'   held-out years. Both can be asked for. `"model"` scores the quantity a
#'   projection is used for (SSB, recruitment); `"observed"` scores the only
#'   thing that was really measured, and is the version comparable to MASE
#'   values published for other assessment platforms.
#' @param forecast_rec How the peeled years get their recruitment.
#'   `"model"` (default here) uses the model's own projection rule, in
#'   precedence order: `proj_mean_rec = TRUE` projects at mean recruitment,
#'   whatever process the model carries, because that is what the setting means;
#'   otherwise the LATENT STATES supply it where the deviations are random
#'   effects (`random_rec = TRUE`, or a DSEM), so an AR1's autocorrelation or a
#'   DSEM's lagged and covariate paths propagate into the forecast; otherwise
#'   recruitment comes off the stock-recruit curve. `"mean"` forces the
#'   historical mean for all of them, which is [retrospective()]'s default and
#'   the convention Mohn's rho is computed under.
#'
#'   The default differs from [retrospective()]'s on purpose. A peel's forecast
#'   years are hindcast years, so `proj_mean_rec` cannot reach them by itself,
#'   and with `"mean"` every model forecasts identically -- which makes this
#'   function unable to tell projection methods apart, the one thing it exists
#'   to do. Measured on the GOA arrowtooth model, `proj_mean_rec = TRUE` and
#'   `FALSE` returned byte-identical MASE under `"mean"`.
#' @param retro Optionally an already-computed [retrospective()] result, to
#'   avoid refitting when both are wanted. Note a `retro` computed with
#'   [retrospective()]'s defaults carries `forecast_rec = "mean"`.
#' @param ... Passed to [retrospective()] (`cores`, `getsd`, `rescale`).
