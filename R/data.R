#'\describe{
#' \item{Fleet_name}{Name of survey or fishery}
#' \item{Fleet_code}{Index of survey/fishery ACROSS species}
#' \item{Fleet_type}{0 or 'Off' = Do not estimate; 1 = 'Fishery'; 2 = 'Survey'}
#' \item{Species}{Species number}
#' \item{Selectivity_index}{Index used to give fleets the same selectivity (otherwise, same as Fleet_code). Fleets sharing a value share one selectivity parameter block, with its penalties and priors accumulated once on the lead fleet (the group's first non-Off fleet). Sharing the parameters is not sufficient on its own: the columns that shape the curve are read per fleet and must match across the group, or the fleets end up with different selectivities. Those are \code{Selectivity}, \code{Selectivity_dimension}, \code{Bin_first_selected}, \code{N_sel_bins}, \code{Sel_norm_bin} and \code{Sel_norm_bin_upper}; a blank counts as a value (a blank \code{Sel_norm_bin} means "do not normalize"). \code{Time_varying_sel} and \code{Sel_start_year} are instead resolved to the group's lead / earliest value, so a difference there is ignored rather than divergent. \code{data_check()} reports both cases. To mirror a fleet, copy its fleet_control row and change only the identity and catchability columns.}
#' \item{Selectivity}{Selectivity form: 0 = "Fixed"; 1 = "Logistic"; 2 = "NonParametric" (Ianelli et al. 2018); 3 = "DoubleLogistic"; 4 = "DescendingLogistic"; 5 = "Hake" non-parametric (Taylor et al. 2014); 6 = "2DAR1"; 7 = "3DAR1" (Cheng et al. 2024); 8 = "DoubleNormal"; 9 = "NonParametricPM" (non-parametric random walk, AMAK "pm"); 11 = "LogisticPM" (logistic with a free age-1 selectivity, AMAK "pm"). Whether a form is age- or length-based is set by Selectivity_dimension.}
#' \item{Selectivity_dimension}{"Age" or "Length".}
#' \item{N_sel_bins}{Number of bins (ages or length bins) to estimate for non-parametric selectivity.}
#' \item{Time_varying_sel}{Whether a time-varying selectivity should be estimated for logistic, double logistic selectivity, or descending logistic. 0 = "Off", 1 = "IID" penalized deviates given sel_sd_prior or random effect, 2 = "AR1" (not yet implemented), 3 = "Block" time blocks with no penalty, 4 = "RandomWalk" following Dorn, 5 = "RandomWalkAscending" on ascending portion of double logistic only.}
#' \item{Time_varying_sel_sd}{The fixed or initial sd to use for time varying selectivity.}
#' \item{Sel_start_year}{First year the fleet's time-varying selectivity deviations are estimated and penalized. Deviations before this year are fixed at 0: they have no data and no penalty (the selectivity penalties are anchored at this year), so estimating them would leave unidentified flat directions. Defaults to the earliest year of data across all fleets sharing the fleet's \code{Selectivity_index} (fleets sharing an index share one selectivity curve), bounded below by \code{styr}. Only used for time-varying selectivity; set explicitly to override.}
#' \item{Bin_first_selected}{Age/length bin at which selectivity is non-zero}
#' \item{Sel_shape_sd, Sel_curvature_sd, Sel_devmag_sd}{Selectivity penalties expressed as standard deviations (an intuitive alternative to the raw penalty weights in Sel_curve_pen1/2/3). Each penalty is a Gaussian SSQ, so the weight is \code{1 / (2 * sd^2)}: Sel_shape_sd is the shape/smoothness penalty (Sel_curve_pen1), Sel_curvature_sd the 2nd-difference curvature penalty (Sel_curve_pen2), Sel_devmag_sd the deviation-magnitude penalty (Sel_curve_pen3). Supplying an SD sets the corresponding Sel_curve_pen column; a legacy Sel_curve_pen value is never overwritten. Sel_shape_sd and Sel_devmag_sd apply to NonParametric (2/9) and LogisticPM (11); Sel_curvature_sd is NonParametric-only (LogisticPM does not use Sel_curve_pen2). The 2DAR1/3DAR1 forms reuse Sel_curve_pen for logit-scale correlations and keep those columns.}
#' \item{Sel_shape_dir}{Direction of the (directional-mode) NonParametric shape penalty when Sel_shape_sd is used: "Decreasing" (default, penalize decreasing selectivity) or "Increasing" (sets the sign of Sel_curve_pen1). LogisticPM's shape penalty is two-sided, so "Increasing" is rejected there.}
#' \item{Sel_curve_pen1}{Raw shape/smoothness penalty weight for non-parametric (type 2/9) and LogisticPM (11) selectivity. The intuitive alternative is Sel_shape_sd, which sets this to \code{1 / (2 * sd^2)}. The 2DAR1/3DAR1 forms reuse this column as a logit-scale correlation.}
#' \item{Sel_curve_pen2}{Raw 2nd-difference curvature penalty weight for non-parametric selectivity (the intuitive alternative is Sel_curvature_sd). Reused as a logit-scale correlation by the 2DAR1/3DAR1 forms.}
#' \item{Sel_curve_pen3}{Raw deviation-magnitude penalty weight for non-parametric / LogisticPM selectivity (the intuitive alternative is Sel_devmag_sd).}
#' \item{Sel_pen_first_bin}{First bin (age or length, on the fleet's Selectivity_dimension) for the non-parametric shape penalty. NA defaults to Bin_first_selected.}
#' \item{Sel_pen_last_bin}{Last (left) bin of the shape-penalty pairs. NA defaults to nbins - 2.}
#' \item{Sel_shape_mode}{Shape-penalty mode: "Directional" (default) or "Smooth" (two-sided second-difference penalty, RTMB).}
#' \item{Sel_avgsel_pen}{Weight on the AMAK average-selectivity base-level penalty (type 9 only): 0 = off (default), 10 matches AMAK.}
#' \item{Sel_cap_bin}{NonParametricRPM selectivity bin cap. NA (default) applies no cap.}
#' \item{Sel_norm_bin}{Age/length bin at which selectivity is normalized to 1 --
#'   an absolute age for an age-based fleet (6 means age 6, not the 6th bin) or a
#'   1-based length-bin ordinal for a length-based one. NA (default) does not
#'   normalize; a value < 0 normalizes by the maximum. In a two-sex model this
#'   says only where the reference is taken -- whether it is pooled across the
#'   sexes is \code{Sel_norm_scope}. NA does not normalize either way, leaving
#'   the relative scale free. See the sex-structure section of
#'   \code{vignette("model-options-and-functionality")}.}
#' \item{Sel_norm_bin_upper}{Optional upper age/length bin for selectivity normalization (default NA). When set, selectivity is normalized by its mean between Sel_norm_bin and Sel_norm_bin_upper.}
#' \item{Sel_norm_scope}{Whether selectivity normalization pools its reference
#'   across sexes, orthogonal to \code{Sel_norm_bin} (which says where the
#'   reference is taken). \code{"WithinSex"} divides each sex by its own
#'   reference, so both reach 1 and only the shape differs by sex;
#'   \code{"AcrossSexes"} (default) pools one reference over both sexes, so the
#'   less-selected sex stays below 1 and relative sex-specific selectivity is
#'   retained. No effect on a one-sex species or where \code{Sel_norm_bin} is
#'   NA.}
#' \item{Observation_units}{Units of the observation: 1 = weight (mt), 2 = numbers caught (thousands of fish). Drives both catch and index prediction.}
#' \item{Weight_index}{Weight-at-age (weight) index to use for calculation of derived quantities}
#' \item{Age_transition_index}{Age transition matrix (e.g. growth trajectory) index to use for derived quantities to convert age to length}
#' \item{Catchability_index}{Index used to give fleets the same catchability. Fleets sharing a value share one q parameter, so the group can carry only one answer to whether q is estimated: the lead fleet (the group's first non-Off fleet) decides for all of them, regardless of fleet type. A fleet with no index_data of its own is therefore still estimated if its group's lead is; give a fleet its own value when it should be estimated independently. This applies to "Fixed", "Estimated" and "Estimated-with-prior". The solved forms -- "Analytical", "AnalyticalArith", "Environmental" and "AR1" -- compute catchability per fleet, from that fleet's own residuals or covariate, so a group containing one does \emph{not} share a catchability even when every fleet in it carries the same setting. \code{data_check()} reports that case, and a differing \code{Catchability} or \code{Time_varying_q} within a group.}
#' \item{Catchability}{Estimate catchability? 0 or "Fixed" = fixed at prior; 1 or "Estimated" = estimate a single parameter; 2 or "Estimated-with-prior" = estimate a single parameter with a prior; 3 or "Analytical" = geometric-mean analytical q (Ludwig and Walters 1994); 4 = power equation (not yet implemented); 5 or "Environmental" = linear equation log(q_y) = q_mu + beta * index_y; 6 or "AR1" = annual AR1 catchability deviates fit to an environmental index (Rogers et al. 2024); 7 or "AnalyticalArith" = arithmetic-mean analytical q = mean(obs)/mean(pred), the AMAK/ebswp form used with the MVN survey likelihood.}
#' \item{Catchability_init}{Starting value (or fixed value) for catchability. When Catchability = "Estimated-with-prior" this also centers the q prior.}
#' \item{Catchability_prior_sd}{Standard deviation of the q prior: dnorm(log_q, log_q_prior, Catchability_prior_sd). Used only when Catchability = "Estimated-with-prior".}
#' \item{Time_varying_q}{Whether a time-varying q should be estimated. 0 = "Off", 1 = "IID" penalized deviate or random effect, 2 = "AR1" (not yet implemented), 3 = "Block" time blocks with no penalty; 4 = "RandomWalk" random walk from mean following Dorn 2018 (dnorm(q_y - q_y-1, 0, sigma). If Catchability = 5 or 6, this determines the environmental index to be used in the equation log(q_y) = q_mu + beta * index_y}
#' \item{Time_varying_q_sd}{The sd to use for the random walk of time varying q if set to 1}
#' \item{Estimate_index_sd}{Estimate survey/index observation SD. Accepts integer codes or readable strings: 0 / "Fixed" = use the fixed SD from the data CV; 1 / "Estimated" = estimate; 2 / "Analytical" = analytically estimate following Ludwig and Walters 1994.}
#' \item{Index_sd}{Starting/fixed value for the index observation SD, used when Estimate_index_sd = "Estimated".}
#' \item{Estimate_catch_sd}{Estimate fishery/catch observation SD. Accepts integer codes or readable strings: 0 / "Fixed" = use the fixed SD from the data CV; 1 / "Estimated" = estimate; 2 / "Analytical" = analytically estimate following Ludwig and Walters 1994.}
#' \item{Catch_sd}{Starting/fixed value for the catch observation SD, used when Estimate_catch_sd = "Estimated".}
#' \item{Index_distribution}{Survey/index biomass observation likelihood family. 0 or "Lognormal" = independent lognormal on the log observation (the default). "MVN" and "MVNORM" both use a multivariate normal on the natural-scale residual vector (obs - q*pred) with a user-supplied full variance-covariance matrix in \code{index_cov} (e.g. a VAST-derived Sigma): 1 or "MVN" reports the bare quadratic form 0.5 * r' Sigma^-1 r (matching the survey likelihood reported by AMAK/ebswp and ADMB); 2 or "MVNORM" reports the full multivariate-normal negative log-density 0.5 * (r' Sigma^-1 r + logdet(Sigma) + n*log(2*pi)). The two give an identical fit (they differ by a fixed constant). Pair either with Catchability = "AnalyticalArith". 3 or "Normal" is an independent normal on the same natural-scale residual, with an ABSOLUTE standard deviation taken from Log_sd (not a log-scale CV); it reproduces the AMAK avo_like/cpue_like term for term. 4 or "TruncatedNormal" is that normal left-truncated at zero: an index cannot be negative, so over the values the data can take the density is renormalized by log Phi(mu/sd). Prefer "TruncatedNormal" unless an exact ADMB comparison is needed -- it is the only natural-scale family \code{sim_mod()} can draw from exactly, since "Normal" and the covariance families have to redraw the non-positive draws \code{data_check()} would refuse.}
#' \item{Comp_distribution}{Age/length composition data distribution. Accepts integer codes or readable strings: -1 or "MultinomialAFSC" (default) = AFSC multinomial; 0 or "Multinomial" = full multinomial; 1 or "DirichletMultinomial".}
#' \item{Comp_weights}{Composition weight. Its scale follows \code{Comp_distribution}: under a multinomial it is the natural-scale multiplier on the input sample size, while under a Dirichlet-multinomial the model uses \code{exp(Comp_weights)}, so the column holds the \emph{log} of the starting weight -- the template default of 1 is a starting weight of \eqn{e}, not 1; use 0 for a weight of 1. It is read when a model is built from scratch, so a refit keeps whatever weight it is given. A fit reports the weight its residuals imply -- a harmonic mean of the ratio of effective to input sample size (McAllister & Ianelli 1997) -- in \code{Comp_weights_mcallister}; \code{\link{reweight_comps}} tunes towards it.}
#' \item{CAAL_distribution}{Conditional age-at-length composition distribution. Accepts integer codes or readable strings: 0 or "Multinomial" (default) = full multinomial; 1 or "DirichletMultinomial".}
#' \item{CAAL_weights}{Conditional age-at-length (CAAL) composition weight. Its scale follows \code{CAAL_distribution} exactly as \code{Comp_weights} follows \code{Comp_distribution}: a natural-scale sample-size multiplier under a multinomial, the \emph{log} of the starting weight under a Dirichlet-multinomial.}
#' \item{Comp_accum_young}{Young-tail composition accumulation bin (AFSC ac_yng): a 1-based ordinal on the fleet's composition dimension; age/length bins below it are folded into it before the likelihood. NA (default) or 1 = no young accumulation.}
#' \item{Comp_accum_old}{Old-tail composition accumulation bin (AFSC ac_old): a 1-based ordinal on the fleet's composition dimension; age/length bins above it are folded into it before the likelihood. NA (default), 0, or a value at/above the number of bins = no old accumulation.}
#' \item{Month}{Observation month for the fleet (0 = not specified).}
#' \item{Proj_F_proportion}{The proportion of future fishing mortality assigned to this fleet.}
