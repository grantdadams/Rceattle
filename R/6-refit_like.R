#' Re-fit a model reusing a source `data_list`'s structural configuration
#'
#' @description
#' Internal engine behind the repeated [fit_mod()] re-invocations in
#' [retrospective()], [jitter()], [self_test()], [profile.Rceattle()],
#' [run_mse()], [remove_F()], [sample_rec()], and [reweight_comps()]. Each of
#' those re-fits a model that shares a source model's structure but changes a few
#' things (a data peel, a jittered start, a projection year, a set of
#' composition weights).
#'
#' This helper reconstructs the harvest-control-rule, stock-recruit,
#' natural-mortality and growth specifications and the shared
#' process switches (`msmMode`, `suitMode`, `random_rec`, ...) from `data_list`
#' (the "...like" part), then calls [fit_mod()]. Every field that genuinely
#' varies across the callers is a named argument that defaults to the
#' `data_list` value, so each call site shows only the handful of things it
#' actually changes.
#'
#' Console suppression is intentionally left to the caller: the call sites wrap
#' this differently (`suppressMessages()`, `suppressWarnings()`, both, or
#' neither), and suppression is console-only -- it does not affect the fit.
#'
#' @param data_list Source `data_list`. Drives both the data to fit and the
#'   reconstructed HCR / recFun / M1Fun / growthFun (unless a field is overridden
#'   below).
#' @param inits Starting parameters (an `estimated_params`-shaped list).
#' @param estimateMode [fit_mod()] estimate mode for this refit. Required and
#'   passed explicitly by every caller (retro/jitter refit at 0, profile at 1,
#'   the MSE OM rebuild at 3, the input-F EM at 2, ...), so it has no default.
#' @param map Parameter map, or `NULL` to let [fit_mod()] build it.
#'
#'   There is deliberately no `bounds` counterpart. Bounds are always rebuilt
#'   from the source `data_list`, which reproduces them exactly for every bound
#'   the schema or the linkage table drives (`linkage_spec(bounds = )`) -- the
#'   documented way to set them. A raw `fit_mod(bounds = )` hand-override is
#'   therefore the one thing a refit does not carry, and carrying it would not be
#'   safe: [run_mse()] grows `log_F` and re-dimensions the selectivity deviation
#'   blocks at every assessment, so the source fit's bounds no longer line up
#'   with the parameters they would be indexed against.
#' @param HCR A pre-built [build_hcr()] object to use instead of reconstructing
#'   one from `data_list` (used for [run_mse()]'s input-F EM refit, whose HCR is
#'   a freshly computed average F rather than the stored rule).
#' @param phase,getsd,loopnum [fit_control()] knobs. `getsd` defaults to `FALSE`
#'   (diagnostics rarely need `sdreport`); `remove_F()` overrides it to `TRUE`.
#'   The bias-adjustment settings are recovered from `data_list` rather than
#'   taken from a caller (see below); every other [fit_control()] field falls
#'   back to its default, so a source model fitted with non-default optimizer
#'   settings (`newtonsteps`, `nlminb_control`, ...) refits under the defaults.
#' @param proj_mean_rec Recruitment projection mode; defaults to the source's.
#'   [run_mse()]'s OM refit pins it to `TRUE` (project on the mean across sims).
#' @param srr_mse_switchyr,srr_hat_styr,srr_hat_endyr Stock-recruit reference
#'   fields; default to the source's values. Callers clamp `srr_mse_switchyr` /
#'   `srr_hat_endyr` to a peel or assessment year, or pin them to the pristine OM.
#' @param suit_styr,suit_endyr Suitability window; default to the source's,
#'   clamped to a peel year or pinned to the pristine OM by some callers.
#'
#' @param dsem DSEM specification to carry into the refit. Defaults to the
#'   source `data_list`'s stored `dsem_settings`, so a refit inherits it.
#' @return The fitted `Rceattle` object returned by [fit_mod()].
