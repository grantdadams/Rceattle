#' Assessment reporting tables from one or more Rceattle fits
#'
#' @description Collects the quantities a stock assessment reports into one set
#' of tidy tables, so a SAFE chapter or a model comparison is built from a
#' single call rather than from a dozen ad-hoc extractions. Every table carries
#' a `model` column, so passing several fits gives a like-for-like comparison.
#'
#' @details
#' The sections follow the AFSC Alaska Groundfish Stock Assessment Guidelines
#' for what a chapter reports:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{`model`}{One row per fit: dimensions, switches, the objective, the
#'     number of estimated parameters, AIC, the maximum gradient, whether the
#'     Hessian was positive definite, and the run time.}
#'   \item{`parameters`}{Every estimated parameter with its standard error, and
#'     the natural-scale name and process from [parameter_dictionary()]. Where
#'     `sigma_R` and an estimated M are found. Estimates are on the parameter's
#'     own scale, so a `log_` name needs `exp()`; a **fixed** M is not here at
#'     all, because it was never estimated — read it off `M_at_age`.}
#'   \item{`likelihood`}{The negative log-likelihood by component and fleet or
#'     species, weighted and unweighted.}
#'   \item{`timeseries`}{Biomass, female spawning-stock biomass, recruitment,
#'     depletion and fishing mortality by species and year, with standard errors
#'     and confidence intervals, split into hindcast (`era = "time"`) and
#'     projection (`era = "fore"`).}
#'   \item{`reference_points`}{The executive-summary quantities: the SPR-based
#'     F proxies, unfished and target female spawning-stock biomass, the biomass
#'     proxies implied by `Ptarget` / `Plimit`, and terminal status. A `basis`
#'     column says whether each was estimated, and if not, why -- see below.}
#'   \item{`fits`}{Observed against predicted index and catch, with the standard
#'     deviation of normalized residuals (SDNR) per fleet.}
#'   \item{`retrospective`, `jitter`, `osa`}{Present only when the corresponding
#'     object is supplied.}
#' }
#'
#' Nothing here refits. The three diagnostics are tens to hundreds of
#' optimizations each, so they are supplied as already-computed objects rather
#' than run inside a table-building call; a section whose object is `NULL` is
#' simply absent from the result.
#'
#' The standard harvest scenarios of guideline section 4.11.3 are **not**
#' produced -- they need a standard projection module, which Rceattle does not
#' have. Projected biomass under the model's own harvest control rule is in
#' `timeseries` with `era = "fore"`.
#'
#' # Reference points a fit does not define
#'
#' A CEATTLE fit leaves a *number* in the reported array for several reference
#' points it never estimated, so reading the array directly puts a plausible
#' wrong figure into the one table that becomes the executive summary. Each is
#' returned as `NA` with the reason in `basis`:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item `Ftarget` / `Flimit` are estimated only under a harvest control rule
#'     that defines them, and are switched off for a species with no projected
#'     fishery or with fixed numbers-at-age. Unestimated, they sit at their
#'     initial value of `exp(0) = 1`, which reads as an F of 1.0/yr.
#'   \item `SB0` / `B0` under `msmMode > 0` come from the `MSSB0` / `MSB0`
#'     inputs, which stand at a placeholder until [fit_mod()] derives them from
#'     a no-fishing projection. `B_target` and `B_limit` are fractions of `SB0`
#'     and go with it.
#'   \item The per-recruit quantities (`SPR0`, `SPRtarget`, `SPRlimit`) are
#'     computed only under `msmMode = 0`.
#' }
#' The depletions are **not** blanked alongside `SB0`: under a no-fishing
#' harvest control rule in multispecies mode the model divides by biomass in the
#' last projection year, which is the equilibrated unfished reference, so the
#' series is meaningful there.
#'
#' @section Two objectives:
#' `model` reports both. `marginal_objective` is what the optimizer minimized —
#' random effects integrated out by the Laplace approximation — and is what
#' `AIC` is built from. `joint_objective` is what the template evaluated at the
#' conditional modes, so it is what `likelihood` sums to. They are equal when
#' `n_random` is 0 and differ by the Laplace correction otherwise.
#'
#' @section Supplying diagnostics for several models:
#' A diagnostics list is matched to models **by name**, so `list(alt = ..., base
#' = ...)` pairs correctly whatever the order. An unnamed list is paired
#' positionally and says so in a message. Names that are not model names are an
#' error -- which catches the realistic mistake of passing one model's
#' [osa_residuals()] result stored as a list of parts.
#'
#' @param object An Rceattle fit from [fit_mod()], or a list of them.
#' @param model_names Names for the models, defaulting to the names of `object`
#'   or to `Model_1`, `Model_2`, ...
#' @param retro A [retrospective()] result per model, or `NULL` (default) to
#'   omit that section.
#' @param jitter A [jitter()] result per model, or `NULL` (default) to omit that
#'   section.
#' @param osa An [osa_residuals()] result per model, summarized with
#'   [osa_diagnostics()], or `NULL` (default) to omit that section.
#' @param ci_level Confidence level for the `timeseries` interval, default
#'   `0.95`.
#' @param quantities Time-series quantities to include, named as in
#'   [quantity_dictionary()].
#'
#' @return A list of data frames with class `"rceattle_report"`, one element per
#'   section described above. Each carries a `model` column.
#'
#' @seealso [quantity_dictionary()] for what each quantity means and its units,
#'   [as.data.frame.Rceattle()] for the time series alone, and
#'   [standard_output()] to relabel the result into the NOAA standardized
#'   assessment output that `stockplotr` and `asar` consume.

#' Rceattle output in the NOAA standardized assessment format
#'
#' @description Relabels [report_tables()] output into the standardized
#' assessment output that the `stockplotr` and `asar` packages consume, so
#' Rceattle results can be plotted and written into a report by the same tools
#' used for SS3, BAM, WHAM and FIMS.
#'
#' @details
#' Quantity names are translated through the `standard_label` column of
#' [quantity_dictionary()], so `ssb` becomes `spawning_biomass`, `R` becomes
#' `recruitment`, `F_spp` becomes `fishing_mortality`, and so on. A quantity the
#' standard has no name for keeps its Rceattle name, so nothing is silently
#' dropped.
#'
#' **The standard has no species dimension.** It describes one stock, so a
#' multispecies CEATTLE fit cannot be represented in it as a whole. A `species`
#' column is carried alongside the standard columns and `species` selects one
#' stock; with several species in the fit and no selection, this errors rather
#' than returning a frame in which two stocks' biomass share a year.
#'
#' `era` follows the standard's own vocabulary: `"time"` for the hindcast the
#' model was fit to, `"fore"` for the projection.
#'
#' @param x An `"rceattle_report"` from [report_tables()], or an Rceattle fit,
#'   which is passed through [report_tables()] first.
#' @param species Which stock to emit, as a name or an index, required when the
#'   fit has more than one.
#' @param model Which model to emit when `x` holds several, defaulting to the
#'   first.
#'
#' @return A data frame with the standardized columns, in the standard's own
#'   order, plus `species` and `model`.
