#' Selectivity specification
#'
#' @description
#' Carries environmental linkages on selectivity parameters. The effect on a
#' parameter is written as a formula and composes additively with any
#' `Time_varying_sel` process error on the same fleet (the two are separate
#' mechanisms: a covariate effect versus a deviation).
#'
#' The parameter names are the shape parameters of the parametric selectivity
#' forms:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{`slp_asc`, `slp_desc`}{ascending / descending logistic slope (log
#'     scale); for a double-normal the ascending / descending width, aliased
#'     `sigma_asc` / `sigma_desc`.}
#'   \item{`inf_asc`, `inf_desc`}{ascending / descending inflection age/length
#'     (natural scale); for a double-normal the peak and the logit right-floor,
#'     aliased `peak` / `right_floor`.}
#'   \item{`coff`}{non-parametric selectivity-at-bin coefficients.}
#'   \item{`apical`}{a multiplier on one sex's whole curve (log scale),
#'     applied after the form and before normalization, so every estimated
#'     form takes it. Name the fleet and the sex that carries it
#'     (`by = ~ fleet + sex`, `fleet = 3`, `sex = "male"`), as Stock
#'     Synthesis's male-offset option does; the other sex is the reference.
#'     See Details.}
#' }
#'
#' Every parameter but `apical` accepts `link = "log"` (multiplicative on the
#' natural parameter) or `link = "identity"` (additive), like the other
#' processes; `apical` is a multiplier already and takes `"log"` only.
#'
#' @details
#' **The `apical` offset.** Fishing mortality is one `log_F` per fleet and
#' year shared by the sexes, so a sex difference in F can only come from
#' selectivity, and no form has a height parameter: the logistic family and
#' DoubleNormal peak at 1 for every sex, the non-parametric forms re-centre
#' each sex, Hake normalizes each sex by its own maximum. `apical` multiplies
#' one sex's curve by `exp(log_sel_apical)`, bin by bin. That equals the ratio
#' of the sexes' peak heights only where their shapes peak equally (the
#' logistic family on an age axis); for a dome with sex-specific shape, read
#' it as the multiplier on that sex's curve and take the peak ratio from
#' `fit$quantities$sel_at_age`. Only the contrast between the sexes is
#' identified (the common level is `log_F`), so one sex carries it and the fit
#' is refused if both do, if no fleet or no sex is named, if the species has
#' one sex, or on a `Fixed`, AR1 or mirror fleet. It is also refused where
#' `Sel_norm_scope = "WithinSex"` normalization would divide it straight back
#' out; use `"AcrossSexes"`, under which the more-selected sex peaks at 1, or
#' turn `Sel_norm_bin` off. The contrast is informed only by joint composition
#' (`comp_data$Sex = 3`); with single-sex compositions it rests on its prior,
#' and `fit_mod()` warns when a fleet has neither. Read the fitted multiplier
#' with `exp(fit$estimated_params$log_sel_apical[fleet, sex])`, and the
#' realized ratio of the sexes' maxima from `fit$quantities$sel_at_age`.
#' Naming `fleet` and `sex` is enough: `by` defaults to `~ fleet + sex` for
#' this parameter.
#' An intercept prior is on the multiplier's natural scale (`lognormal()`
#' centred on 1 means no offset). Like every selectivity linkage, a covariate
#' on it acts in the hindcast years; projection years carry the last hindcast
#' year's curve.
#'
#' **Priors on a selectivity parameter.** An intercept-only formula (`~ 1`) with
#' a `priors` entry places a prior on the selectivity parameter itself (no
#' year-to-year offset is added). Read the prior on the parameter's own scale:
#' the slopes (`slp_asc` / `slp_desc`) are on the log scale (use `lognormal()`),
#' the inflections (`inf_asc` / `inf_desc`) on the natural scale (use `normal()`).
#' See Examples for a normal prior on the ascending inflection. This mirrors the
#' prior-only [build_composition()] path.
#'
#' A selectivity prior targets one parameter, so in a two-sex model an
#' unstratified `~ 1` prior constrains sex 1 only -- use `by = ~ sex` for a
#' per-sex prior. An `init` on a selectivity intercept has no effect (the
#' starting value comes from the data), and a prior on the double-normal
#' `right_floor` is not supported.
#' For a fleet that mirrors another fleet's selectivity (shared
#' `Selectivity_index`), place the prior on the lead fleet so the shared
#' parameter block is not penalized more than once.
#'
#' @param linkages Optional named list of [linkage_spec()] objects keyed by
#'   selectivity parameter. Coefficients are per fleet by default
#'   (`by = ~ fleet`); use the `fleet` argument of [linkage_spec()] to restrict
#'   a spec to particular fleets.
#'
#' @return A list of selectivity settings for [fit_mod()].
