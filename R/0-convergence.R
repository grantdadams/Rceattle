#' Did a diagnostic re-fit converge well enough to keep?
#'
#' @description
#' The shared keep/drop gate for the re-fitting diagnostics,
#' [retrospective()], [jitter()], [self_test()] and [profile.Rceattle()], each
#' of which silently drops the runs that did not converge.
#'
#' These call sites used to test `opt$Convergence_check` against the string
#' `TMBhelper::fit_tmb()` uses for a non-invertible Hessian. `fit_tmb()` assigns
#' that particular string in exactly one place, when `sdreport` returns
#' `pdHess = FALSE`, and the test could not work in either direction:
#'
#' * with `getsd = TRUE`, `fit_tmb()` returns early when the Hessian fails
#'   `chol()`, so it never reaches that assignment, and the shape it returns
#'   instead holds no `Convergence_check` at all, the run was dropped by the
#'   enclosing `is.null()` guard, by accident rather than by the test;
#' * with `getsd = FALSE` the assignment is unreachable, so *nothing* was ever
#'   dropped, a run that ended with a maximum gradient of 1e13 counted as
#'   converged. (`Convergence_check` is still set, but to one of the two gradient
#'   verdicts, neither of which the test matched.)
#'
#' So judge the gradient, which is available either way.
#' `.capture_opt_convergence()` recomputes it from the objective function when
#' the optimizer did not report one, and `fit_mod()` captures that snapshot from
#' the *hindcast* optimization, before any projection re-optimization overwrites
#' `opt`.
#'
#' This judges the model it is handed, so a caller that re-fits more than once
#' has to call it more than once: [retrospective()] runs a second, F-only refit
#' whose gradient says nothing about whether the peeled hindcast converged, and
#' gates on both.
#'
#' The threshold is [convergence_diagnostics()]'s own `max_gradient` FAIL tier
#' and compares the same way (`>`, not `>=`), so the two cannot disagree at the
#' boundary. Deliberately the FAIL tier and not the tighter WARN tier (1e-3):
#' dropping a run is destroying it, so the bar for that is "this fit is broken",
#' not "this fit is worth a look".
#'
#' Two consequences worth being explicit about, since dropping is silent to
#' anything that only reads `length()`:
#'
#' * this is an OPTIMIZER gate, not the whole battery. A kept run can still
#'   hold a WARN (gradient between 1e-3 and 1) or even a FAIL from one of the
#'   other checks, a non-positive-definite Hessian, a non-identifiable
#'   parameter, a stock-recruit curve under the replacement line. Read
#'   `$convergence` on what comes back; do not treat "returned" as "clean";
#' * the one case that drops without a matching battery record is a non-finite
#'   gradient. `.check_optimizer()` emits nothing at all then (it guards on
#'   `is.finite`), so the battery can say OK for a run this drops. A `NaN`
#'   gradient is a diverged fit, which is exactly what the gate is for.
#'
#' This is the gate for the diagnostics that DROP runs. [run_mse()] also re-fits
#' through `.refit_like()` and is deliberately not gated: an MSE cannot skip an
#' assessment year, so a bad estimation-model fit has to propagate rather than
#' vanish.
#'
#' @param newmod A fitted `Rceattle`, or `NULL`.
#' @param max_grad Drop the run above this maximum absolute marginal gradient.
#'   Defaults to 1, `.check_optimizer()`'s FAIL tier.
#' @return `TRUE` to keep the run, `FALSE` to drop it.

#' Run one diagnostic re-fit under an optional wall-clock limit
#'
#' @description
#' `.fit_tmb()` optimizes with `eval.max = iter.max = 1e9`, so a re-fit that

#' evaluations rather than inside one. That is enough here (`nlminb` re-enters R
#' every evaluation) but a single very long evaluation can overrun it.

#' A process variance estimated to zero
#'
#' A deviation standard deviation at the floor means the process it governs is
#' not varying: a model configured as time-varying has fitted something
#' time-invariant. `Atka2022` under `random_sel = TRUE` with a non-parametric
#' random walk reaches `sel_dev_sd = 2.7e-08`. The battery flags that particular
#' fit through `max_gradient`, which reports that the optimizer stopped, not what
#' went wrong; and a collapse at a CLEAN gradient, a well-posed maximum at the
#' boundary, has nothing else to catch it.
#'
#' Scope is deliberately narrow. Only the standard deviations of a modelled
#' DEVIATION are read, all of which are log-scale and O(0.1)-O(1) in any
#' assessment, so one absolute threshold means the same thing for all of them.
#' Observation sds (`catch_log_sd`, `index_log_sd`, `log_obs_sd_linkage`) are
#' excluded: a concentrated observation sd at zero is a different diagnosis, it
#' already trips `parameters_on_bounds` because `build_bounds()` bounds those,
#' and it governs no time-varying process. `growth_log_sd` is excluded because it
#' is a length-at-age sd in CENTIMETRES, where 1e-3 means nothing. Correlations
#' and penalty weights (`sel_curve_pen`, `M1_rho`,
#' `trans_rho_linkage`) are not sds at all, and the catchability PRIOR sd
#' (`index_q_log_sd`) is a deliberate choice.
#'
#' `WARN`, never `FAIL`: a variance at the boundary is a well-posed optimum and a
#' verdict about the MODEL, not about the optimizer, and `report_tables()` prints
#' this status as a fit's `converged` field.
#'
#' Only estimated parameters appear in the snapshot, so a deviation sd held at
#' `Time_varying_sel_sd` cannot fire this.
