# Population dynamics
CEATTLE is an age-structured model that follows cohorts of individuals of a species, age, and sex through time. Annual recruitment and the initial age-structure are estimated and are treated as random effects or as penalized deviates, with the variance in recruitment estimated or fixed, respectively. Populations can be modelled as 1- or 2-sexes via `nsex` in the data. The sex-ratio at birth $\rho_{i1}$ is set in the `sex_ratio` data for the first age. Natural mortality is partitioned into predation mortality (M2) and non-predation related mortality (M1), the latter of which is either input or estimated (`estM1`), and accounts for mortality related to causes other than predation by the species included in the model. Predation can be turned off by setting `msmMode = 0` (see below for more detail).

$$N_{is1,y} = R_{is,y} = \bar{R}_{i }e^{\tau_{i,y}}*\rho_{i1}$$
$$N_{isa,1} = \left \{ \begin{array}{} \bar{R}_ie^{ \left( -j M1_{isa} \right)}*\rho_{i1} \\ \frac{\bar{R}_ie^{ \left( -\sum^{a-1} M1_{isa} \right)}} {\left(1 - e^{\left( -\sum^{a-1} M1_{is A_i} \right)} \right)} *\rho_{i1} \end{array} \right.$$
$$N_{is a+1, y+1} = N_{isa,y} e^{-Z_{isa,y}}$$
$$N_{is A_i, y+1} = N_{is A_{i}-1,y} e^{-Z_{is A_{i}-1,y}} + N_{is A_{i},y} e^{-Z_{is A_{i},y}}$$
$$B_{isa,y} = N_{isa,y} W_{isa,y}$$
$$SSB_{isa,y} = B_{isa,y} \rho_{ia}$$
$$Z_{isa,y} = M1_{isa} + M2_{isa,y} + F_{isa,y}$$

# Predation sub-model
Multiple age-based predation parameterizations are supported by Rceattle and are controlled by `suitMode` defining the predator-prey preference (suitability/predator selectivity) and `msmMode` defining the functional response of predation. The data used to parameterize the predation model include the proportion of prey-at-age in the diet of a predator-at-age (`UobsAgeWt` in the data) and the ration/consumption data (defined below).

## Suitability
Suitability represents a predatorâ€™s prey and size preference and factors such as spatial overlap in the distribution of predators and prey. 

### MSVPA Type 2 based suitability
Suitability can be derived empirically from the ratio of mean proportion (by weight) of prey-at-age in the stomach of predators-at-age. Magnusson (1995) provides details on the derivation of suitability coefficients.
`suitMode = 0`
Predator-prey suitability for predators of species $p$, sex $b$, age $j$, and prey of species $i$, sex $s$ and age $a$
$$\hat{S}_{pbjisa} = \frac{1}{n_y} \sum_y \left( \frac{ \frac{\bar{U}_{pbjisa}} {B_{isa,y}} } {\sum_{isa} \left( \frac{\bar{U}_{pbjisa}} {B_{isa,y}} \right) + \frac{1 + \sum_{isa} \bar{U}_{pbjisa}} {B_p^{other}} } \right)$$

Mean gravimetric diet proportion (proportion of prey-at-age in the diet of a predator-at-age: `UobsAgeWt` in data):
$$\bar{U}_{pbjisa} = \frac{\sum_y {U_{pbjisa,y}}} {n_y}$$

## Predation mortality

### Single-species mode
`msmMode = 0`
$$M2_{isa,y} = 0$$

### MSVPA Type 2 based predation mortality
`msmMode = 1`

Predation mortality equations for predators of species $p$, sex $b$, age $j$, and prey of species $i$, sex $s$ and age $a$
$$M2_{isa,y} = \sum_{pbj} \left( \frac{N_{pbj,y} \delta_{pbj,y} {S}_{pbjisa}} {\sum_{isa} \left({S}_{pbjisa} B_{isa,y} \right) + B_p^{other} \left(1 - \sum_{isa} \left({S}_{pbjisa} \right) \right)} \right)$$


## Consumption
Multiple age-based consumption parameterizations are supported by Rceattle. They include a environmentally driven bioenergetics consumption and direction input of consumption-at-age. The consumption model is controlled by the following objects in the data (`bioenergetics_control` sheet of the excel data input):

* `Ceq`	Integer: switch for which bioenergetics equation to use for each species for ft to scale max consumtion: 1 = Exponential (Stewart et al 1983), 2 = Temperature-dependendence for warm-water species (Kitchell et al 1977; sensu Holsman et al 2015), 3 = temperature dependence for cool and cold-water species (Thornton and Lessem 1979); 4 = 1 for direct input of consumption in Pyrs  where consumption at age = Wt * `Pyrs` (CA set to 1, fday set to 1, CB set to 0)
* `Cindex`	Integer: which environmental index in env_data to use to use for $T_y$ for bioenergetics based ration
* `Pvalue`	Tuning parameter $\varphi_p$ that scales the maximum consumption used for ration for each species
* `fday` Data $Fday_p$ number of foraging days per year for each species
* `CA`	Parameter $\alpha^{\delta}_p$ for slope of allometric mass function for calculating maximum consumption: CA * Weight ^ CB
* `CB`	Parameter $\beta^{\delta}_p$ for slope of allometric mass function for calculating maximum consumption: CA * Weight ^ 1+CB
* `Qc`	Parameter $Q^c_p$ for temperature scaling function of maximum consumption specified by `Ceq`
* `Tco`	Parameter $T^{co}_p$ for temperature scaling function of maximum consumption specified by `Ceq`
* `Tcm`	Parameter $T^{cm}_p$ for temperature scaling function of maximum consumption specified by `Ceq`
* `Tcl`	Parameter $T^{cl}_p$ for temperature scaling function of maximum consumption specified by `Ceq`
* `CK1`	Parameter $CK1_p$ for temperature scaling function of maximum consumption specified by `Ceq`
* `CK4`	Parameter $CK4_p$ for temperature scaling function of maximum consumption specified by `Ceq`

`Pyrs` $RFR_{pbj,y}$ is the relative foraging rate data used to modify ration. Essentially relative foraging rate and, subsequently, ration can be tuned via `fday` and `pvalue`.

The weight-at-age used for the consumption equations is specified by `pop_wt_index`

### Bioenergetics based ration
`Ceq %in% 1:3`
Individual specific ration ($\delta_{pbj,y}$ $(kg~kg^{-1}~yr^{-1})$) of predator $p$ of sex $b$ and age $j$ in year $y$:
$$\delta_{pbj,y} = RFR_{pbj,y}*Fday_p *\alpha^{\delta}_p W_{pbj,y}^{\left(1+\beta^{\delta}_p\right)} *f\left(T_y \right)_p$$
Ration can be tuned by adjusting `Pvalue` ($\varphi_p$) to help convergence:
$$\delta_{pbj,y} = \varphi_p * \delta_{pbj,y}$$

*Temperature scaling algorithms. *

`Ceq = 1`: Exponential function from Stewart et al. 1983:
$$f \left(T_y \right)_p = e^{Q^c_p *T_y}$$

`Ceq = 2`: Temperature dependence for warm-water-species from Kitchell et al. 1977:
$$f \left(T_y \right)_p = V^X e^{\left(X \left(1-V \right) \right)}$$
$$V = \left( T^{cm}_p - T_y \right)/ \left( T^{cm}_p - T^{co}_p \right)$$
$$X = \left(Z^2 \left(1+ \left( 1 + 40 /Y \right)^{0.5} \right)^2 \right)/400$$
$$Z = ln\left(Q^c_p \right) \left( T^{cm}_p - T^{co}_p \right)$$
$$Y = ln\left(Q^c_p \right) \left( T^{cm}_p - T^{co}_p + 2\right)$$

`Ceq = 3`: Temperature dependence for cool and cold-water species from Thornton and Lessem 1979:
$$f \left(T_y \right)_p = Ka * Kb$$
$$Ka = C^{K1}_p * L_1 / (1+C^{K1}_p * (L_1 - 1 ))$$
$$L_1 = e^{G_1 * (T_y - Q^c_p)}$$
$$G_1 = \frac{1}{T^{co}_p-Q^c_p}*\log\left(\frac{0.98*(1-CK1_p)}{CK1_p*0.02}\right)$$
$$Kb = \frac{CK4_p *L_2} {1+CK4_p*(L_2-1)}$$
$$L_2 = e^{G_2 (T^{cl}_p - T_y)}$$
$$G_2 = \frac{1}{T^{cl}_p-T^{cm}_p}*\log\left( \frac{0.98*(1-CK4_p)}{CK4_p*0.02}\right)$$

### Input ration-at-age
`Ceq = 4` and for directly input of consumption-at-sex/age in the `Pyrs` data sheet for $RFR_{pbj,y}$. Set `CA = 1`, `fday = 1`, and `CB = 0`.
$$\delta_{pbj,y} = RFR_{pbj,y}* W_{pbj,y} $$


# Fishery and survey observation model
CEATTLE is fit to time series of fishery and survey biomass, sex-ratio, and length- or age-composition data. Log-fishery catch, log-survey biomass and sex-ratio are assumed to be normally distributed, while age- and length-composition data are fit assuming multinomial distributions. Variance parameters for the lognormal distributions and initial input sample size for the multinomial distributions can be assumed known or for surveys also estimated as a free parameter or estimated analytically following Walters and Ludwig (1994). Separate selectivity and catchability functions can be estimated or input for each survey or fishery.

Catch is estimated in the model following the Baranov catch equation:
$$\hat{C}_{isa,y} = \frac{F_{isa,y}} {Z_{isa,y}} \left( 1 - e^{-Z_{isa,y}} \right) N_{isa,y}$$
$$\hat{C}_{i,y} = \sum_s\sum_a^{A_i} \frac{F_isa,y} {Z_{isa,y}} \left( 1 - e^{-Z_{isa,y}} \right) N_{isa,y} W_{isa,y}$$
$$F_{isa,y} = \bar{F}_{f_i}e^{\epsilon_{{f_i},y} s_{{f_i}sa}}$$
CPUE data is estimated given catchability $q_{f_iy}$, selectivity $S_{f_isa,y}$, and fleet month $Month_{f_i}$ and can either be in biomass $\hat{CPUE:B}_{{f_i},y}$ or numbers $\hat{CPUE:I}_{{f_i},y}$:
$$\hat{CPUE:B}_{{f_i},y} = \sum_s\sum_a \left( N_{isa,y} e^{-Month_{f_i} Z_{isa,y}} W_{{f_i}sa,y} S_{{f_i}isa,y} * q_{{f_i}y} \right)$$
$$\hat{CPUE:I}_{{f_i},y} = \sum_s\sum_a \left( N_{isa,y} e^{-Month_{f_i} Z_{isa,y}} S_{{f_i}isa,y} * q_{{f_i}y} \right)$$


## Selectivity parameterizations
Multiple age-based selectivity functions are supported by Rceattle. They are controlled by `Selectivity_index`, `Selectivity`, `Nselages`, `Time_varying_sel`, `Sel_sd_prior`, and `Age_first_selected` in fleet_control sheet of an Rceattle data file. They are defined as follows:

* `Selectivity_index`:	index to use if selectivities of different surveys are to be the same
* `Selectivity`:	Selectivity parameterization to use for the species: 0 = empirical selectivity provided in `srv_emp_sel`; 1 = logistic selectivity; 2 = non-parametric selecitivty sensu Ianelli et al 2018; 3 = double logistic; 4 = descending logistic; 5 = non-parametric selectivity sensu Taylor et al 2014 (Hake)
* `Nselages`:	Number of ages to estimate non-parametric selectivity for Selectivity = 2 & 5. For example, if `minage = 1` and selectivity parameters are estimated up till age-6, `Nselages = 6` and if `minage = 0` and selectivity parameters are estimated up till age-6, `Nselages = 7`.  Not used otherwise
* `Time_varying_sel`:	Whether a time-varying selectivity should be estimated for logistic, double logistic selectivity, descending logistic, or non-parametric selectivity (`Selectivity = 5`). 0 = no, 1 = penalized deviates given sel_sd_prior, 2 = penalized deviates and estimate sel_sd_prior, 3 = time blocks with no penalty, 4 = random walk following Dorn, 5 = random walk on ascending portion of double logistic only. If selectivity is set to type = 2 (non-parametric) this value will be the 1st penalty on selectivity.
* `Sel_sd_prior`:	The sd to use for the random walk of time varying selectivity if set to 1. If selectivity is set to type = 2 (non-parametric) this value will be the 2nd penalty on selectivity.
* `Age_first_selected`:	Age at which selectivity is non-zero. Selectivity before this age will be set to 0.

$$\phi_{f_i sy}-\phi_{f_i sy-1} \sim N(0,\sigma^{\phi}_{f_i}) $$

### Non-parametric (Type 2)
For each age $a \geq A_{min}$ there is an incremental selectivity parameter $p_{f_i say}$ for the fleet $f_i$. Selectivity at age is calculated as follows:

$$sel_{f_i sa}=e^{sel^{`}_{f_i sa} - max(sel^{`}_{f_i sa})}$$
where
$$ sel^{`}_{f_i sa} = \sum_{i=A_{min}}^a p_{f_i sa}$$
Selectivity is fixed at $sel_{f_i sa} = 0$ for $a < A_{min}$ and $p_{f_i sa} = 0$ for ages above `minage + Nselages`, giving constant selectivity beyond the last estimated value. `minage` is specified in the data and is the minimum age of the modeled population.

Input:
`Selectivity = 5`, `Nselages = 6`, `Time_varying_sel = NA`,  `Sel_sd_prior = NA`, and `Age_first_selected = `$A_{min}$

### Time-varying non-parametric (Type 2)
As above, but a set of deviations on $p_a$ is used  to control annual changes in selectivity given a fixed or estimated standard deviation ($\sigma^{\phi}_{f_i}$):
$$p_{f_i say}=p_{f_i sa}+\phi_{f_i say}$$

Input:
`Selectivity = 5`, `Nselages = 6`, `Time_varying_sel = NA`,  `Sel_sd_prior = NA`, and `Age_first_selected = `$A_{min}$

Penalized likelihood: `Time_varying_sel = 1`
$$\phi_{f_i sy} \sim N(0,\sigma^{\phi}_{f_i}) $$
Random effect: `Time_varying_sel = 2` $\hat\sigma^{\phi}_{f_i}$ is estimated
$$\phi_{f_i sy} \sim N(0,\hat\sigma^{\phi}_{f_i}) $$


## Catchability parameterizations
Separate selectivity and catchability functions can be estimated for each survey or fishery. Additionally, catchability can be set the same for multiple surveys by setting `Q_index` to the same value. Catchability is controlled by the following parameters in the `fleet_control` sheet of the data

* `Q_index`	index to use if catchability coefficients are to be set the same
* `Estimate_q`	Estimate catchability? (0 = fixed at prior; - 1 = Estimate single parameter; - 2 = Estimate single parameter with prior; - 3 = Estimate analytical q  from Ludwig and Walters 1994;  - 4 = Estimate power equation (Not supported); - 5 - Linear equation (Not yet supported) log(q_y) = q_mu + beta * index_y)
* `Q_prior`	Starting value or fixed value for catchability
* `Q_sd_prior`	Variance of q prior: dnorm (log_q, log_q_prior, q_sd_prior)
* `Time_varying_q`	Wether a time-varying q should be estimated. 0 = no, 1 = penalized deviate, 2 = random effect, 3 = time blocks with no penalty; 4 = random walk from mean following Dorn 2018 (dnorm(q_y - q_y-1, 0, sigma). If Estimate_q = 5, this determines the environmental index to be used in the equation log(q_y) = q_mu + beta * index_y
* `Time_varying_q_sd_prior`	The sd to use for the random walk of time varying q if set to 1

### Linear time-invariant catchability formulations
`Time_varying_q = 0` for all formulations
`Estimate_q = 0`

$q_{f_i} =$ `Q_prior` from data

`Estimate_q = 1` A freely estimated catchability parameter $\hat{q}_{f_i}$ is estimated for survey/index fleet $f_i$

$$q_{f_i} = \hat{q}_{f_i}$$

`Estimate_q = 2` A freely estimated catchability parameter $\hat{q}_{f_i}$ is estimated for survey/index fleet $f_i$ assuming a lognormal prior

$$ \hat{q}_{f_i} \sim lognormal(log(Q\ prior), Q\ sd\ prior) $$

`Estimate_q = 3` Catchability $\hat{q}_{f_i}$ is analytically derived for survey/index fleet $f_i$ following Walters and Ludwig (1994). 
* For CPUE in weight with time-invariant standard error of the survey:
$$\hat{q}_{f_i} = \exp\left( \sum_y log \left[ \frac{CPUE:B_{{f_i},y}}  {\sum_s\sum_a \left( N_{isa,y} e^{-Month_{f_i} Z_{isa,y}} W_{{f_i}sa,y} S_{{f_i}isa,y} \right)} \right]/n \right)$$
* For CPUE in numbers with time-invariant standard error of the survey
$$\hat{q}_{f_i} = \exp\left( \sum_y log \left[ \frac{CPUE:I_{{f_i},y}}  {\sum_s\sum_a \left( N_{isa,y} e^{-Month_{f_i} Z_{isa,y}} S_{{f_i}isa,y} \right)} \right]/n \right)$$
* For CPUE in weight with time-varying standard error of the survey
$$\hat{q}_{f_i} = \exp\left( \sum_y \left( log \left[ \frac{CPUE:B_{{f_i},y}}  {\sum_s\sum_a N_{isa,y} e^{-Month_{f_i} Z_{isa,y}} W_{{f_i}sa,y} S_{{f_i}isa,y}} \right]/\sigma^{2}_{f_iy} \right)/ \sum_y{\frac{1}{\sigma^{2}_{f_iy}}} \right)$$
* For CPUE in numbers with time-varying standard error of the survey
$$\hat{q}_{f_i} = \exp\left( \sum_y \left( log \left[ \frac{CPUE:I_{{f_i},y}}  {\sum_s\sum_a N_{isa,y} e^{-Month_{f_i} Z_{isa,y}} S_{{f_i}isa,y}} \right]/\sigma^{2}_{f_iy} \right)/ \sum_y{\frac{1}{\sigma^{2}_{f_iy}}} \right)$$

### Time-varying catchability formulations
*Annual catchability estimated via penalized likelihood or as random effects* 

NOTE: If `Estimate_q = 2` a prior will be put on mean catchability as above.
`Estimate_q %in% c(1:2)` and `Time_varying_q %in% c(1:2)`
$$\hat{q}_{f_iy} = e^{\bar{q}_{f_i}+ \omega_{f_iy}}$$
$\omega_{f_iy} \sim N(0,$`Time_varying_q_sd_prior`$)$ where `Time_varying_q_sd_prior` is either fixed `Time_varying_q = 1` or estimated `Time_varying_q = 2` & `random_q = TRUE` in \function{fit_mod}

*Catchability time-blocks*

`Estimate_q %in% c(1:2)`, `Time_varying_q = 3` where the blocks are based on the blocks in `srv_biom` data sheet.
$$\hat{q}_{f_iy} = e^{\omega_{f_i block_y}}$$

*Annual catchability via random walk*

`Estimate_q %in% c(1:2)`, `Time_varying_q = 4`
$$\hat{q}_{f_iy} = e^{\bar{q}_{f_i}+ \omega_{f_iy}}$$
$\omega_{f_iy} \sim N(\omega_{f_iy-1},$`Time_varying_q_sd_prior`$)$
