# Verified traps

Each entry is something that has actually bitten, with the evidence. `CLAUDE.md` carries a
one-line version of the ones you need before touching the code; this file holds the detail and
the measured numbers so a claim can be checked rather than believed.

Verified against source, 2026-08.

## Build and test

**Dev builds are `-O2`, not pkgbuild's `-O0`.** The repo `.Rprofile` sets
`options(pkg.build_extra_flags = FALSE)`, so `load_all()` compiles the TMB model with the same
optimization as a production `R CMD INSTALL` — `fit_mod()` runs ~10x faster than an
unoptimized debug build, bit-identically (measured). A normal install was always `-O2`; only
`load_all` was `-O0`. To debug the C++ line-by-line (gdb/lldb), start R with
`RCEATTLE_DEBUG_CPP=1`. **Any absolute fit timing must state its build** — an `-O0` number
overstates real cost ~10x.

**A slow fit is the model, not a regression.** A full `BS2017SS` `estimateMode = 0,
phase = TRUE` fit is ~55 s: ~14 s for one optimization, ~3x for phasing, +~14 s for
`sdreport`. That single fit has needed ~500–700 `nlminb` iterations since at least 2023
(bisected back through `main`), so don't hunt a recent cause. For dev loops
`phase = FALSE, getsd = FALSE` gives ~14 s.

**The parallel-test DLL failure is a toolchain failure, not a test failure.**
`DESCRIPTION` sets `Config/testthat/parallel: true`, and the workers cannot load a freshly
rebuilt DLL, so `devtools::test()` aborts before running anything with
`testthat subprocess failed to start … getDLLRegisteredRoutines.DLLInfo`. After a `.cpp`/`.hpp`
edit run `pkgload::load_all(".")` first, then test with `TESTTHAT_PARALLEL=false`.
(`test-coverage.yaml` forces serial for a related reason.)

**Roxygen is pinned at 8.1.0** (`DESCRIPTION: Config/roxygen2/version`). A *different* local
roxygen2 rewrites *every* `man/*.Rd`; an older one also swaps the key back to the legacy
`RoxygenNote:`, leaving both present and contradicting each other. After `document()`, check
`git diff DESCRIPTION` **first**: if the version key moved, the `man/` churn is the version, not
your change. Either regenerate everything under one version deliberately, or `git checkout` the
unrelated churn and keep only the `.Rd` you meant to change. A matching version is necessary but
not sufficient — the build environment can rewrite `man/` and `NAMESPACE` too.

## Shared parameter blocks

**Fleets sharing a `Selectivity_index` / `Q_index` share ONE parameter block.**
`adjust_map_shared_params()` copies the donor fleet's map slice over the rest of the group, so
any per-fleet setting that differs within a group is silently taken from the donor
(`Sel_start_year`, `Bin_first_selected`, `N_sel_bins`, …). The donor is the first *estimated*
fleet — an `Off` fleet's slice is all `NA` and must never lead. Penalties and priors on a shared
block are accumulated once, on the lead fleet (`flt_sel_lead` / `flt_q_lead`); without that gate
they are counted once per sharing fleet.

**Worked example: GOA2018SS.** Fleets 1 and 7 share selectivity; fleets 9 and 10 share
selectivity *and* q.

## Silent-wrong-number traps

**`Index_distribution` has a second hand-synced registry.** A family added to
`index_distribution_map` (`R/0-switches.R`) must also be classified in
`.index_rows_natural_scale()` in the same file, which is what `residuals(type = "pearson")`,
`plot_index()`'s observation interval and `plot_indexresidual()` read to pick a scale. A
natural-scale family that misses it **does not error** — it silently gets the log-scale formula,
whose `sigma^2/2` is then a number the size of the index squared.
`test-index-natural-scale-downstream.R` enumerates the map and is the net.

**`nages` is a COUNT of age bins, not the oldest age.** Ages run
`minage .. minage + nages - 1`, and the array's 3rd dimension is a 1-based bin index, so age `a`
is at index `a - minage + 1`. `minage = 1` makes the two coincide — which is every bundled
dataset and all three live assessments — so a bin/age confusion passes every test and every real
model, and only shows up on the next `minage != 1` species. Write
`seq_len(nages[sp]) - 1 + minage[sp]` and mean it.

**A `data_list` element with no `write_data()`/`read_data()` support round-trips to nothing.**
The feature is then silently lossy through the standard xlsx format. This is how `index_cov` was
lost.

**A `Comp_weights` of 1 under a Dirichlet-multinomial is a starting weight of e.** That
likelihood reads the column as a log (`DM_pars_comp = exp(comp_weights)`); a multinomial reads it
as a natural-scale multiplier. `write_template()` seeds 1. `fit_mod()` reports this since 5.11.0.

**Golden reference: `BS2017SS = 10241.0304272585`,** measured on `dev` 2026-08-21 with the
`/golden-check` recipe (every fit at `newtonsteps = 3`). Other values have been quoted in this
repo's tooling and were wrong. The constants are platform-independent (verified across Windows
and macOS/arm64 to 16 digits), but on a new machine capture the baseline **before** the change
you want to test — a failure you cannot attribute is worse than no check.

## Coverage gaps in the golden check

`/golden-check` fits four models and diffs the result. It does not reach:

- **The refit paths.** Eight entry points re-invoke `fit_mod()` through `.refit_like()`. Use
  `tools/verify/verify-refit-like.R`, which covers six of them —
  `sample_rec(update_model = TRUE)` and `reweight_comps()` are **not** in it.
- **The simulation draws.** `tools/verify/verify-sim-*.R`.
- **Any figure.** A plotter can change every number it draws and stay green. The net is
  `tests/testthat/test-plot-*.R` plus a before/after `ggplot_build()` diff at the merge base.
- **Linkage rows.** The four golden models carry none. The constructive linkage tests
  (`test-dynamics-recruitment-linkage.R`, `test-linkage-random-effects.R`) are the net.
- **Selectivity normalization.** No bundled dataset enters the normalization block in
  `selectivity.hpp` — every one has `Sel_norm_bin` all-`NA` except one-sex `Atka2022` — so the
  four reference fits pass trivially through any change to it. `GOA2018SS` *is* reachable
  (species 9, arrowtooth, is two-sex) once you set a named `Sel_norm_bin`; that is exactly how
  `681f3ba0` shipped with `test-selectivity-normalization.R` failing.
- **Growth.** `growth_fun` is unset on BS2017SS and GOA2018SS, so `growth.hpp`'s SDAA path —
  `sd_plus_group` included — is never exercised. Covered constructively by the
  `test-growth-*.R` files.

**`goa_ms` (fixed-M GOA multispecies) sits on a flat likelihood ridge:** the same objective at
different `par`/`ssb` across *different* code, though deterministic on same-code re-runs. Judge
it on `obj`/`jnll`, not `par`/`ssb`.
