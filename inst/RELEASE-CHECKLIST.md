# Pre-release checklist

Steps to run *before* tagging a new version of Rceattle. This is a
research / management-facing package, so the priority is reproducibility
and clear release notes — not speed.

## 1. Source state

- [ ] All in-progress changes committed; working tree clean
      (`git status`).
- [ ] `DESCRIPTION` `Version:` field bumped (semver: bump patch for
      bug fixes / docs, minor for new features, major for breaking
      API changes).
- [ ] `NEWS.md` top section heading matches the new version. Convert any
      "Unreleased" placeholder to the version number. Headings carry the
      version alone, with no date, so that one entry can cite another as
      `# Rceattle X.Y.Z` without going stale.

## 2. Verify

```r
# Regenerate man/ and NAMESPACE from roxygen comments
roxygen2::roxygenise()

# Locally
devtools::document()
devtools::test()

# Vignettes (rendering, not just chunk parsing)
devtools::build_vignettes()

# CRAN-equivalent check
devtools::check(args = c("--no-manual", "--as-cran"))

# URL rot
urlchecker::url_check()

# Spell check (DESCRIPTION + man/)
devtools::spell_check()
```

All four should be 0 errors / 0 warnings. The `installed size`
NOTE is acceptable until we move large `data/` objects to
`inst/extdata/`.

## 3. Tag

Tags are the bare version, **no `v` prefix**: `4.4.0`, `4.8.0`, `5.8.1`,
`5.20.0`. Only the very first tag, `v4.3.0`, carried one. Consumers pin
against these, so the shape has to stay put.

```bash
# Replace X.Y.Z with the DESCRIPTION version. Tag the MERGE COMMIT on
# main -- the commit CI actually validated -- not a local branch head.
git fetch origin main
git tag -a X.Y.Z origin/main -m "Rceattle X.Y.Z"
git push origin X.Y.Z
```

The `pkgdown` GitHub Actions workflow rebuilds the website on the
`release` event, so a GitHub Release must be published from the tag —
drafting one is not enough, the event is `release: published`.

Write the body; do not paste `NEWS.md`. A release that folds a dozen
versions spans well over a thousand lines there, and the reader needs the
short answer: what forces a refit, what breaks, what is new. Follow the
5.8.1 and 5.20.0 bodies — a "results change" table of change against
effect, then breaking changes, then new features — and link `NEWS.md` for
the detail.

```bash
gh release create X.Y.Z --title "Rceattle X.Y.Z" --notes-file notes.md --latest
```

## 3b. Dispatch the deep checks

`deep-checks` runs the golden regression and the bounds-checked build, and
**nothing else does** — it is `skip_on_cran()` and `skip_on_covr()`, so it
fires in neither `R-CMD-check` nor `test-coverage`. GitHub reads `schedule`
and `workflow_dispatch` from the default branch only, so a release is the
first moment it can run against the new code:

```bash
gh workflow run deep-checks.yaml --ref main
```

## 4. Confirm reproducible install

From a clean R session on a different machine (or in a `renv` sandbox):

```r
# A temporary library, so verifying a release does not overwrite the
# working install in the middle of an assessment.
withr::with_temp_libpaths(
  remotes::install_github("grantdadams/Rceattle@X.Y.Z"))
library(Rceattle)
packageVersion("Rceattle")  # should match X.Y.Z
citation("Rceattle")        # should list all references
example("fit_mod", package = "Rceattle", give.lines = TRUE)
```

## 5. Operational consumers

For users running Rceattle inside an assessment / MSE pipeline, communicate
that they should pin to the new tag in their lockfile (`renv.lock`) or
`DESCRIPTION` `Remotes:` field rather than tracking `main`. The
maintainer email in `DESCRIPTION` is the formal contact.

`../Rceattle-models`, `../GOA-ATF-ESP` and `../GOA-multispecies-assessment`
consume this API directly; see `inst/dev/SIBLING-REPOS.md`.

## 6. (Optional) CRAN submission

When ready:

```r
devtools::release()
```

This reads `cran-comments.md` and uploads to CRAN via the official
submission form.
