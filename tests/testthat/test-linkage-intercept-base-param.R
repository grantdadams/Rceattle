# =============================================================================
# An intercept `init` sets the BASE parameter's starting value, for every
# process the linkage grammar covers.
#
# An intercept-bearing formula emits an "(Intercept)" row whose coefficient is
# mapped out at 0; the base parameter carries the level. So `init` on that
# column is a request about the base parameter, and it means the same thing
# whichever process the linkage is attached to. Values are given on the
# parameter's natural scale, and land logged wherever the base parameter is
# stored logged -- everything except sel_inf, whose inflections are ages or
# length midpoints held unlogged.
#
# These are pinned per process because each writes into a different tensor, and
# a process omitted from the push accepts the init, records it in the linkage
# table, and silently does nothing with it -- which is what q, selectivity and
# composition all did before.
