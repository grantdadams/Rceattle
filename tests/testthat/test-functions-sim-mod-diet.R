# Stomach contents are drawn by the TMB model's SIMULATE block, beside the diet
# density (ceattle.cpp, section 13.2). Before that they were the one observation
# type never simulated, so a multispecies self_test() refit against the same
# stomachs every replicate and recovered suitability from data that never varied.
#
# The check that matters is the ROUND TRIP: take the simulated stomach
# proportions, put them through the transform a refit applies (append the "other
# prey" balance, add comp_offset, renormalize), and compare their mean to the
# proportions the density predicts. That is what the estimator actually sees.
#
# Comparing the RAW simulated proportions to the offset-normalized prediction
# instead -- the obvious-looking check -- cannot detect a draw that is centred on
# the wrong one of the two, because at the default comp_offset the two targets
# differ by only ~0.02%. Raise comp_offset to give the test power.

# The fixture and helpers live in helpers-diet-sim.R; the expensive round-trip,
# over-dispersion and weight tests live in the sibling files named for them.
