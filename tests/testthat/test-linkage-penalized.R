# Penalized fixed-effect linkage deviations: linkage_spec(integrate = FALSE).
#
# A random-effect term's deviations are normally integrated out by the Laplace
# approximation. `integrate = FALSE` instead estimates them as a plain penalized
# fixed effect, which is what the ADMB/AMAK reference models (and the legacy
# Time_varying_sel / Time_varying_q switches) do. It is permitted only when the
# deviation SD is fixed: a variance is consistently estimated only by
# integrating, so estimating the deviations AND their SD jointly as fixed
# effects is degenerate -- the likelihood improves without bound as both go to
# zero. The guards below are the constructor-level half of that contract; the
# pooled-group half lives in .re_group_table().
