# These live in a helper rather than in one test file because that file was 66%
# of the whole coverage run: ~1200 sim_mod() calls at nrep = 150, each
# evaluating the compiled model through covr-instrumented R, which took ~78
# minutes of a 119-minute suite and set the wall-clock floor no matter how many
# shards it was split across. The assertions are unchanged; they are spread over
# several files so the shard planner can put them on different runners.
#
# `.diet_sim_env` caches the base fit per PROCESS, so files that land on the
# same shard still fit it once between them.

# Per stomach, in diet_data row order: the prey proportions the density predicts
# (offset and renormalized), and the same transform applied to a simulated row.

# NOTE the parameter `diet_comp_weights` means different things by family: for
# the multinomial it is used raw, as a likelihood weight / effective-sample-size
# multiplier (1 = neutral), and for the Dirichlet-multinomial it is log theta
# (exp() is taken). Passing log(1) = 0 for a multinomial sets the weight to
# ZERO, which drops the data from the likelihood and from the draw.
