# self_test() on a DSEM.
#
# WHAT A SELF TEST MEANS HERE, because it is easy to over-read: sim_mod() draws
# new OBSERVATIONS in R from the fitted quantities. It does not redraw the
# process random effects -- dsem.hpp's SIMULATE blocks were commented out when
# the header was vendored (they need `this`, and calculate_dsem() is a free
# function), and ceattle.cpp has none. So the fitted recruitment deviations are
# held fixed and the test asks whether the model recovers itself under fresh
# observation error. Under a DSEM those deviations come from the latent states,
# which are likewise held fixed, so the SEM's own process is never re-realized.
# That is the same limitation the standard recruitment path already has. A clean
# self test therefore says nothing about how well the SEM structure is
# identified across recruitment realizations.
#
# What it does establish, and what these tests pin: the simulated data really is
# different, the refit re-estimates the DSEM rather than echoing the parent back,
# and the replicates converge.
