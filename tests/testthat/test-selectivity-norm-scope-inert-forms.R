# Sel_norm_scope is read only by the shared normalizer in selectivity.hpp. Hake
# normalizes each sex to its own maximum in its own block, and LogisticPM reads
# Sel_norm_bin as a penalty range, so on a two-sex fleet of either form the
# column changes nothing: measured on GOAatf fleet 3 (Hake, two sexes), the two
# scopes gave identical selectivity and objective (46.4710) to every digit.
