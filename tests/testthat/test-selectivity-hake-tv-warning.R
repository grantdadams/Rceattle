# =============================================================================
# Time_varying_sel compatibility warning for "Hake" (Taylor et al. 2014)
# selectivity, in build_map_selectivity().
#
# The Hake form supports exactly two time-varying modes -- "Off" (0), i.e. the
# bin coefficients with no annual deviates, and "IID" (1), penalized coefficient
# deviates -- and data_check() enforces that set. The map builder's guard used to
# be `tv_sel != "IID"`, which fired on "Off" as well and so warned about a
# configuration its own message (and the validator) call legal.
#
# switch_check() canonicalizes the integer 0 to the string "Off", so a fleet
# entered as Time_varying_sel = 0 reaches the guard as "Off" -- which is what
# made the spurious warning read "Current value: Off". fit_mod() wraps build_map()
# in suppressWarnings(), so it surfaced only in the callers that build the map
# directly (run_mse(), retrospective()).
