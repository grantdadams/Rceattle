# functions. This is the committed backstop for "numeric changes need golden
# equivalence" -- any edit that moves a reference fit fails here.
#
# The multispecies fits are warm-started from their single-species MLEs (the
# predation likelihood is non-convex, so the start point selects the local
# optimum); the GOA multispecies fit uses fixed M. See the /golden-check
# command for the recipe these constants were generated from.

# =============================================================================
# Golden reference by CONFIGURATION.
#
# The four fits above share one configuration: plain multinomial compositions, a
# lognormal index, no tail accumulation, fixed recruitment. So the likelihood
# branches the ecosystem models actually run had no golden cover, and a change
# confined to one of them could not fail here. Plain Multinomial is not even the
# schema default for Comp_distribution -- MultinomialAFSC is -- so the branch a
# model gets when the column is left out was unpinned as well. Each block below
# switches on a single branch, on the same BS2017SS data, so a failure points at
# the branch rather than at the model.
#
# Still unpinned after this, and worth adding if they ever break: CAAL, length
# compositions, nonparametric selectivity, and any multispecies combination of
# the branches below -- both multispecies references run the default setup.
#
# Each pinned value was measured under exactly the fit_control settings its
# block uses, and checked for basin robustness first. A pin whose basin is not
# unique fails on another platform's optimizer path for reasons unrelated to any
# code change, which is what the multi-OS check already sees on the phased
# integration fits. For the three cheap fits that check was six jittered starts
# (sd = 0.1), which spread the objective by ~1e-11 relative, matching the four
# references above. The random-recruitment fit is too slow to jitter six times;
# its evidence is instead that the phased and unphased optimizer paths agree to
# 1e-13 relative -- path robustness rather than start-point robustness, which is
# weaker, so treat a failure there as worth investigating before re-pinning.
#
# Dirichlet-multinomial is pinned WITH a prior on theta, and cannot be pinned
# without one. BS2017SS's compositions do not identify the DM theta on their
# own: as theta grows the Dirichlet-multinomial tends to the multinomial, so
# with uninformative comps there is no interior optimum. Bare DM shows exactly
# that -- phased it stops at max|grad| ~ 2 on 'comp_weights' with the
# convergence diagnostic reporting FAIL, unphased it reaches only 2.9e-4, and
# phased and unphased land 3 objective units apart (3.2e-4 relative, ~300x the
# tolerance here), so a pinned value would track the phasing path rather than
# the model. Its jitter spread is 5.7e-8: passable today, but ~2000x looser
# than every other reference here and the first margin to go on another
# platform. The gamma prior below identifies theta instead of masking it --
# theta lands finite and per-fleet (0.54 to 17.0) rather than running to the
# multinomial limit, the gradient falls to 3.9e-11, and the jitter spread
# tightens to 1.7e-11, in line with the rest of this file. The prior path is
# itself untested elsewhere at the fit level, so this pin covers the linkage
# grammar's intercept-prior machinery as well as the DM likelihood.
