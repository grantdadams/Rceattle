# Time_varying_sel_sd must be positive wherever the template reads it.
#
# Provenance: build_params() takes log(Time_varying_sel_sd), so a blank, zero or
# negative value became a -Inf/NaN starting value and the objective was not
# finite at the first evaluation -- reported from inside MakeADFun, naming
# neither the fleet nor the column. Time_varying_q_sd had this check; its
# selectivity twin did not.
#
# The gate is the (Selectivity, Time_varying_sel) PAIR, transcribed from the
# four sel_dev_sd density sites in ceattle.cpp section 15.2, so a combination
# that penalizes nothing is not asked for a value it would never read. These
# tests pin both halves: it fires where the sd is read, and stays quiet where it
# is not.
