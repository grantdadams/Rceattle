# `Sel_norm_bin` says where selectivity is normalized to 1. It took a number that
# encoded three different intents with nothing in the value to say which: blank
# meant "do not normalize", anything negative meant "by the maximum", and a
# positive number was an absolute age (or a length bin). It now takes the words
# too, and refuses a bin the fleet is not selected over.
#
# The values every workbook in the ecosystem already carries -- blank, 0, -1,
# -999 and a positive bin -- must keep reaching TMB as exactly the same code.
# That parity is the point of most of this file.
