# =============================================================================
# A refit reproduces the source model's linkage structure.
#
# fit_mod() takes qFun / selFun / compFun as the source of truth for
# data_list$q_linkages / sel_linkages / comp_linkages, so .refit_like() rebuilds
# all three from the source model. That is what makes a refit the same model:
# the linkage table sizes the beta_linkage parameter block, which has to stay
# matched to the parameters carried over in `inits`.
#
# Every diagnostic that re-fits -- retrospective(), jitter(), self_test(),
# profile(), run_mse(), remove_F(), sample_rec() -- routes through
# .refit_like(), so this covers all of them.
