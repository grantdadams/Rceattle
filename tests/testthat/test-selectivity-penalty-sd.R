# instead of the cryptic penalty WEIGHTS. Every such penalty is a Gaussian SSQ
# (weight * x^2 = x^2 / (2*sd^2)), so switch_check() converts the SD columns
# (Sel_shape_sd [+ Sel_shape_dir], Sel_curvature_sd, Sel_devmag_sd) into
# Sel_curve_pen1/2/3 via weight = 1/(2*sd^2). Legacy Sel_curve_pen columns are
# left untouched (so existing models are bit-identical); a fleet supplying the SD
# columns fits equivalently to the same model expressed as weights.
