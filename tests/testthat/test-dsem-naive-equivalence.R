# A NAIVE (IID) DSEM must reproduce a non-DSEM model -- not just in the fit, but
# through the diagnostics.
#
# A base DSEM is only the per-species two-headed self-loop, so the GMRF reduces
# to N(0, sigma) on the recruitment deviations: the standard density once the
# lognormal bias correction is off. The FIT equivalence was already pinned
# (test-dsem-recruitment-hook.R). This pins the RETROSPECTIVE, which was not, and
# which is where two real defects hid:
#
#   1. fit_mod() dropped the DSEM blocks out of a supplied `inits`
#      (build_params() does not declare them, so start_par[names(.skel)] removed
#      them and merge_dsem_params() refilled from the template). Invisible
#      wherever the DSEM is estimated -- any start reaches the same MLE -- and
#      wrong wherever it is PINNED. retrospective()'s forecast refit pins the
#      whole DSEM, so every peel ran with beta_z at its start value: sigma_R =
#      0.707107 for every species, an 80% error in the peeled hindcast, and
#      Mohn's rho flipped sign (-0.49 against +0.13).
#   2. The forecast bias adjustment wrote rec_dev, which the template overwrites
#      from the latent states -- a silent no-op that left the GMRF's own
#      projection in place and moved forecast recruitment ~44%.
#
# Both only show up against the non-DSEM path, which is why comparing a DSEM peel
# to a DSEM refit (as the earlier verification did) could not catch either.
