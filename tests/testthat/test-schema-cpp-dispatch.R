# Every switch code exists three times: as a name in an R map (R/0-switches.R or
# a R/0-build_*.R constructor), as a string literal in build_map() or
# build_params(), and as a `case` label in the C++. Nothing binds them. A code
# added to a map with no branch to run, or a branch with no name to select it,
# is invisible until a user picks the option and gets silence or the wrong arm.
#
# This test binds the first and third: it reads the `case` labels out of the
# template and requires them to be exactly the map's values, minus a PINNED
# exemption in each direction. The exemptions are the point -- they are the
# machine-checked inventory of "implemented in C++ but unreachable from R" and
# "reachable from R but handled before dispatch", which otherwise lives as prose
# in three different phrasings.

# Strip comments before scanning, for two reasons. A retired feature is commented
# out rather than deleted here -- `// DATA_INTEGER(est_diet);` and
# `// DATA_INTEGER(avgnMode);` both sit at the top of ceattle.cpp -- so a scanner
# reading the raw text calls a dead declaration live. And the whole Kinzey
# predation block in predation.hpp is inside a /* ... */, so its `switch
# (msmMode)` would otherwise be reported as live dispatch; it is also what
# unbalances the brace count for every file concatenated after it.
