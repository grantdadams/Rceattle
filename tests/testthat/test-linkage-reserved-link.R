# Regression tests for the reserved-but-unimplemented "logit" link.
#
# `LINKAGE_LINKS` shares its codes with src/TMB/linkage.hpp, but every
# accumulator there gates on linkfn == 1 (log) or linkfn == 0 (identity).
# A logit row therefore used to encode cleanly, be estimated, and
# contribute exactly zero to every offset tensor -- while
# map_linkage_adjuster() still masked its base parameter, fixing the
# process parameter at its init with nothing replacing it. It must be
# rejected up front until an accumulator implements it.
