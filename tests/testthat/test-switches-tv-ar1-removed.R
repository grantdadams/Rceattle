# Time_varying_sel / Time_varying_q = "AR1" (value 2) are removed in 5.16.0.
#
# Provenance: the value was accepted by validate_switches() and then scored by
# the template with the SAME independent normal penalty as "IID"
# (`flt_varying_sel == 1 || == 2`, `index_varying_q == 1 || == 2`). No
# correlation parameter was ever read -- index_q_rho belongs to the removed
# Catchability = "AR1" (QAR1) path, and selectivity has no equivalent. So a
# fleet set to "AR1" fitted independent deviations under a name that promised
# correlated ones, silently. These tests pin the refusal, the redirect, and the
# fact that "IID" is the exact fit the removed value gave.
