# A deviation standard deviation that has been estimated to zero.
#
# Provenance. `Atka2022` under `random_sel = TRUE` with a non-parametric random
# walk returns an objective of 185.82 and `sel_dev_sd = 2.7e-08`: a
# time-invariant selectivity fitted by a model configured as time-varying. The
# battery flags that fit through `max_gradient`, which reports that the optimizer
# stopped rather than what went wrong; collapse can also occur at a CLEAN
# gradient, for data reasons -- few composition years, small sample sizes, or a
# composition weight competing with the process variance -- and nothing else
# catches that.
#
# What these tests do and do not establish. `fit_mod()` now refuses the
# configuration above, so the collapse cannot be produced from a supported
# setting and the third test below injects the value instead. That exercises the
# threshold and the message, NOT the wiring. The wiring was checked separately by
# running that fit on the pre-change package: `sel_dev_log_sd` reaches
# `.conv_hindcast$par` carrying 2.69e-08, so a collapsing fit does put a small
# value under a name this check reads. Every other name in `.CONV_PROCESS_SD` is
# wired by the same mechanism but has not been observed collapsing in a real fit;
# `R_log_sd` and `log_sigma_linkage` are confirmed present and healthy below.
