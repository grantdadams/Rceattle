# asks the template for log F(x) and log(1 - F(x)) of each conditional, gated by
# keep.cdf_lower / keep.cdf_upper, and returns qnorm(F(x)). No conditional mean
# is formed, so nothing can leave the support of a bounded observation.
#
# The conditional for a composition bin is a binomial, written through the
# regularized incomplete beta so it is defined at the fractional counts
# composition data carry:  P(X <= x) = 1 - I_p(x + 1, n - x).  The aggregate
# series are normal (lognormal catch and index on the log scale, "Normal" and
# "MVN" on their own), so theirs is pnorm.
#
# The distributional acceptance test -- residualizing simulated data at the
# parameters that generated it, where the answer is exactly N(0, 1) -- lives in
# tools/verify/verify-osa-cdf.R, which is far too slow for the suite. What is
# here is everything that pins the implementation: the identity the CDF is built
# on, the bin alignment through the keep reorder, the invariance of the
