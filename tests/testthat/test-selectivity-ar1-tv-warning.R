# =============================================================================
# Time_varying_sel compatibility warning for the 2DAR1 / 3DAR1 selectivity
# forms, in build_map_selectivity().
#
# The AR1 forms carry their own annual deviations -- the field supplies them,
# with the correlations estimated from Sel_curve_pen1/2/3 -- so a
# Time_varying_sel setting has nothing left to do, and the builder says which
# fleet it overrode. "Off" asks for no extra deviation layer, so it agrees with
# the AR1 field rather than conflicting with it, and is silent.
#
# Provenance: a live GOA pollock 2DAR1 run setting Time_varying_sel = "Off"
# warned that its choice was ignored. The same class on the Hake form is
# test-selectivity-hake-tv-warning.R, which is why both AR1 forms are pinned
# here rather than only the one reported.
#
# NA is not covered: build_map_selectivity() reaches `if (tv_sel == "Block")`
# before any AR1 branch and errors on a missing value, for every selectivity
# form. That is a separate gap.
