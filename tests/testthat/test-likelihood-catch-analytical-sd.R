# Estimate_catch_sd = "Analytical" (2) concentrates the observation sd out of
# the catch likelihood instead of fixing or estimating it.
#
# Until 5.12.0 the option was documented in the schema, accepted by
# validate_switches(), and treated as a real mode by build_map() (which maps
# catch_log_sd out) -- but the template's dispatch had only case 0 and case 1,
# so the fit died with "Invalid 'Estimate_sigma_catch'" after passing every R
# check. est_sigma_index had implemented case 2 all along; this is its mirror.
#
# Rceattle fits catch to a mean-unbiased prediction
# (log(obs) ~ N(log(pred) - b*sigma^2/2, sigma), b = bias_adjust_obs, default 1),
# so the sd that minimises that density is
#   sigma^2 = 2*S / (sqrt(1 + b^2*S) + 1),   S = mean squared log residual,
# which reduces to the Ludwig and Walters (1994) sqrt(S) only at b = 0. The
# second test below is the one that pins this: it profiles the real catch
# likelihood over sigma rather than re-deriving the same expression the
# template computes, which is what an earlier draft did and could not have
# caught the bias term being left out.
