# Everything downstream of the index likelihood has to know which SCALE the
# fleet is fitted on.
#
# `Lognormal` (0) is a log-scale family whose `Log_sd` is a CV / log-sd.
# `MVN` (1), `MVNORM` (2), `Normal` (3) and `TruncatedNormal` (4) are
# natural-scale families whose sd is ABSOLUTE, in the units of the index.
# Applying a log-scale formula to the second group does not error, it silently
# returns nonsense: `sigma^2 / 2` becomes a number the size of the index squared.
#
# These pin the two places that got it wrong -- the Pearson residual and the
# observation interval -- with fixtures where the wrong answer is not subtle.
#
# Guarded per test rather than per file: the registry-drift check below runs no
# fit and is the one test here that should run under a plain R CMD check.
