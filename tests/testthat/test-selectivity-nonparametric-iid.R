# Time-varying non-parametric (Ianelli, type 2) selectivity.
#
# Provenance. `Time_varying_sel = "IID"` on a non-parametric fleet was refused by
# build_map() and data_check() even though the bundled `Atka2022` -- and the ADMB
# bridge it comes from (`Rceattle-models/BSAI atka mackerel/2022 atka
# bridging.R`) -- is configured exactly that way, so that dataset could not be
# fitted as shipped. 5.25.0 scores the mode instead of refusing it:
# `dnorm(sel_coff_dev, 0, sel_dev_sd)` on each estimated coefficient.
#
# Why the two modes are not interchangeable, and why only one may be integrated:
# "RandomWalk" scores the year-to-year change in the REALIZED log-selectivity,
# which is renormalized to mean 1 within each year. The level of a year's
# coefficients does not enter that density, so `sel_dev_sd` is not identified
# from it and Laplace-integrating the deviates drives it to zero -- measured at
# 2.7e-8 on Atka2022, which is a time-invariant selectivity reported as a
# time-varying one. "IID" scores the deviations themselves and does identify the
# sd. But the AMAK shape penalties and the average-selectivity term are charged
# on each year's realized curve and do not scale with the sd, so the density
# integrated is tilted and the reported sd is biased low: fit_mod() refuses
# `random_sel = TRUE` for the walk because the density is improper, and for IID
# because the sd it would report is not the sd of the deviations.
