# A retrospective peel must not shrink a random effect's process SD.
#
# Provenance: 5.15.0 stopped pinning the peeled tail of a random-effect block,
# because a pinned deviation is still scored by its density and "the deviation
# was exactly zero" is the strongest possible evidence for a small SD -- worth
# -6.6% on sigma at 5 peels, and monotone in peel depth, so it becomes a trend in
# the quantity Mohn's rho measures. Selectivity was exempted wholesale at the
# time because SOME selectivity forms are penalized with a bare sum of squares
# rather than a normalized density, and freeing one of those biases the SD the
# other way (-k*log(sigma) in the objective, unbounded above).
#
# The exemption was too broad: the exempt forms are a property of the FLEET, not
# of the parameter block, and 2DAR1/3DAR1/Hake fleets are scored by proper
# densities. These tests pin the per-fleet split so neither bias returns.
#
# The mapping this asserts lives in ceattle.cpp slots 4-5; .rce_sel_unnormalized_rows()
# carries the term-by-term table.
