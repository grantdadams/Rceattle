# CAAL is the age composition WITHIN a length bin, so the model predicts it as
# selectivity-at-length convolved with the growth matrix (ceattle.cpp, section
# 10.2). selectivity.hpp writes sel_at_length only for a length-dimensioned
# fleet and leaves it zero otherwise, so pred_CAAL on an age-dimensioned fleet
# is zero however the surrounding gates are written -- there is no
# selectivity-at-length to convolve with.
#
# The likelihood still runs. With pred_CAAL zero, comp_offset makes the
# predicted composition uniform, so the observations are scored against a flat
# composition no parameter can move: they add a term to the objective and inform
# nothing. Selectivity_dimension defaults to "Age", so this is the default
# outcome for anyone adding CAAL data rather than an unusual mistake.
