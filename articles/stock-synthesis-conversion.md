# 7. Converting from Stock Synthesis

This vignette is a working guide for converting a Stock Synthesis (SS3)
model into the Rceattle data structure. It follows the SS files
top-to-bottom, copying each block into the corresponding Rceattle data
sheet. Rceattle column / sheet names are shown in `code` font.

The example below references the 2019 Pacific hake assessment, which is
publicly available on Nis Sand Jacobsen’s
[`PacifichakeMSE`](https://github.com/nissandjac/PacifichakeMSE/tree/master/inst/extdata/SS32019)
GitHub repo. With the exception of consumption / diet (which SS does not
estimate), every input Rceattle needs is somewhere in the SS data,
weight-at-age, or control file.

> **Updated for Rceattle 4.0+ data structure.** Several `data_list`
> columns and sheet names changed in 4.0.1 (`Pyrs` → `ration_data`,
> `UobsWtAge` → `diet_data`, `fsh_biom` → `catch_data`, `srv_biom` →
> `index_data`, `Nselages` → `N_sel_bins`, `Age_first_selected` →
> `Bin_first_selected`, `Age_max_selected` / `_upper` → `Sel_norm_bin` /
> `Sel_norm_bin_upper`). The instructions below use the current names.
> The sheet `meta_data` inside the Rceattle Excel template is the
> authoritative column reference.

## Model controls

From the SS data file (`hake_data.ss`) into the Rceattle Excel sheet
`control`:

| SS field | Rceattle (`control` sheet) | Notes |
|----|----|----|
| `styr` (1966) | `styr` | First year of hindcast |
| `endyr` (2019) | `endyr` | Last year of hindcast |
| `Nsexes` (1) | `nsex` | 1 = combined-sex; 2 = sex-structured |
| `Nages` (20) | `nages` | Maximum age class |
| `_spawn_month` | `spawn_month` | Calendar month of spawning |
| — | `minage` | Set to 1; age 0 is currently first-age only |
| — | `projyr` | Pick a projection terminal year |

## Fleets

From `#fleetinfo` in the SS data file into the Rceattle `fleet_control`
sheet — one row per fleet:

| SS field | Rceattle (`fleet_control`) | Notes |
|----|----|----|
| `fleetname` | `Fleet_name` |  |
| (assign) | `Fleet_code` | Unique integer; must be in order |
| `fleet_type` | `Fleet_type` | `1` = fishery, `2` = survey, `0` = ignore |
| (associate) | `Species` | Species the fleet observes |
| (per-fleet) | `Month` | Month of observation (added in 4.0.1) |

The `meta_data` sheet in the Rceattle Excel template documents every
remaining column on `fleet_control` (selectivity, catchability,
composition likelihood, etc.).

## Catch data

SS catch data → Rceattle `catch_data` sheet:

| SS field | Rceattle (`catch_data`) | Notes |
|----|----|----|
| `year` | `Year` |  |
| `seas` | `Month` | Currently informational; Baranov is annual |
| `fleet` | `Fleet_code` | Re-map if the codes differ from SS |
| `catch` | `Catch` | Convert to mt – Rceattle works in mt and thousands of fish throughout (see [`?plot_timeseries`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/plot_timeseries.md)) |
| `catch_se` | `Log_sd` | Lognormal F-dev SD |

## Survey indices

The CPUE / survey configuration is split across two Rceattle sheets:

- `fleet_control` for the *fleet-level* options (units, SD estimation,
  catchability formulation):

| SS / behavior | Rceattle (`fleet_control`) | Notes |
|----|----|----|
| Units (numbers / biomass) | `Observation_units` | `1` = biomass, `2` = numbers |
| (estimate index SD?) | `Estimate_index_sd` | `0` = supplied, `1` = estimated |
| Q estimation | `Catchability`, `Catchability_init`, `Catchability_prior_sd` | See vignette 0 §4 for the option table |
| Time-varying q | `Time_varying_q`, `Time_varying_q_sd` |  |

- `index_data` for the year-level *observations*:

| SS field | Rceattle (`index_data`) | Notes |
|----|----|----|
| `index` | `Fleet_code` |  |
| `year` | `Year` | Make `Year` negative to predict but exclude from likelihood (parallel to SS’s negative `index` convention) |
| `seas` | `Month` | Adjusts biomass / numbers by mortality up to that month |
| `OBS` | `Observation` |  |
| `se_log` | `Log_sd` | Lognormal observation SD |

Discards are not a first-class concept in Rceattle 4.x; treat them as a
separate fishery fleet with its own selectivity if needed.

## Composition data

SS `_lencomp` and `_agecomp` blocks → Rceattle `comp_data` sheet (one
table for both age and length comps; the `Age0_Length1` column
distinguishes them).

`fleet_control`:

| SS field | Rceattle (`fleet_control`) | Notes |
|----|----|----|
| `_N_lbins` (26) | `nlengths` (on `control` sheet) | Number of length bins |
| Sex aggregation | `Sex` column on `comp_data` | Hake is single-sex |
| Comp likelihood | `Comp_distribution` | `0` = multinomial, `1` = Dirichlet-multinomial. (`-1` = legacy AFSC convention.) |
| Selectivity bin range | `Sel_norm_bin`, `Sel_norm_bin_upper`, `Bin_first_selected` | First selected bin and the bin(s) at which selectivity is normalized to 1 |

`comp_data`:

| SS field    | Rceattle (`comp_data`) | Notes                              |
|-------------|------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `FltSvy`    | `Fleet_code`           |                                    |
| `year`      | `Year`                 |                                    |
| `seas`      | `Month`                |                                    |
| `gender`    | `Sex`                  | See `meta_data` for sex codings    |
| `Nsamp`     | `Sample_size`          |                                    |
| `a1, a2, …` | `Comp_1, Comp_2, …`    | One column per age (or length) bin |
| —           | `Age0_Length1`         | `0` = age comp, `1` = length comp  |

If the SS comp data covers fewer ages than `nages` (e.g. comps to age 15
in a 20-age model), set `Sel_norm_bin` / `Sel_norm_bin_upper` and
`N_sel_bins` to control how the missing ages are accumulated. Check the
assessment document or contact the authors before deciding whether to
zero-pad or accumulate at the upper age.

For a two-sex conversion, `Sel_norm_scope` decides whether the
normalization reference is pooled over the sexes (`"AcrossSexes"`, the
default, which keeps relative sex-specific selectivity) or taken per sex
(`"WithinSex"`). Note that Rceattle has no equivalent of the SS male
apical-selectivity offset: relative sex selectivity is carried by the
normalization scope and by joint (`comp_data$Sex = 3`) composition data,
not by an offset parameter.

`Part`, `Ageerr`, `Lbin_lo`, `Lbin_hi`, `CompressBins`, `CompError`,
`ParmSelect`, and `minsamplesize` from SS do not have direct Rceattle
equivalents.

## Ageing error

SS allows year- and sex-varying age-error matrices. Rceattle currently
supports one species-specific, time- and sex-invariant matrix per
species, on the `age_error` sheet. For hake the matrices are time-
invariant, so no aggregation is needed; convert per the SS manual and
copy the result into `age_error`.

## Weight-at-age

SS weight-at-age (`wtatage.ss`) → Rceattle `weight` sheet (note: the
in-package list slot is `wt`).

- For each weight-at-age matrix in SS, generate a `Wt_name` and
  `Wt_index` for Rceattle.
- `year` → `Year`; `gender` → `Sex` (see `meta_data`); SS columns
  `a1, a2, …` → `Age1, Age2, …`.
- On `fleet_control`, point `Weight_index` for each fleet at the
  appropriate `Wt_index`.
- On `control`, point `pop_wt_index` and `ssb_wt_index` for each species
  at the appropriate `Wt_index`.

> **SSB hack for SS weight-at-age:** SSB is computed as Σ_(a)(N · weight
> · maturity). If the SS `wtatage.ss` already bakes maturity into a
> weight-at-age schedule, point `ssb_wt_index` at that schedule and set
> every entry of the `maturity` sheet to `1`.

If SS estimates weight-at-age (rather than reading it from data), copy
from `wtatage_new.ss` instead — bearing in mind the estimates are
conditional on the SS population dynamics and are therefore mildly
circular when ported to Rceattle.

## Other inputs

- `sex_ratio` sheet — typically `0.5` for all ages. Hake assessments use
  this convention.
- `M1_base` sheet — values from the assessment document. To estimate M
  rather than fix it, configure `M1Fun = build_M1(M1_model = …)` on
  [`fit_mod()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/fit_mod.md).
  See vignette 0 §7 for the option table.
- `age_trans_matrix` sheet — converts age-at-length to length-at-age.
  Set every entry to `0` if the assessment has no length data; for
  models with length comps, fill from the SS age-length transition.
- `ration_data` and `diet_data` (multi-species only) — diet /
  consumption inputs. SS does not provide these; derive externally if
  fitting a multi-species CEATTLE.

## Verifying the conversion against SS

The most common check is to feed Rceattle the SS-estimated selectivity
and numbers-at-age and confirm the resulting catches and indices match
SS:

1.  Run the SS model (or use the SS report file).
2.  Copy SS selectivity per fleet to the `emp_sel` sheet.
3.  Copy SS numbers-at-age to the `NByageFixed` sheet.
4.  Set `Selectivity = 0` (“Fixed”) for each fleet on `fleet_control`
    and `estDynamics = 1` for each species on `control` (this fixes
    N-at-age to `NByageFixed`).
5.  Run `fit_mod(estimateMode = 1, ...)` to evaluate without re-fitting.

Differences between Rceattle and SS at this stage trace back to either
(a) a coercion bug in the data port, (b) a different mortality
convention (Rceattle’s Baranov is annual, SS allows seasonal), or (c) a
likelihood difference (Rceattle currently supports multinomial and
Dirichlet-multinomial for comps; not the SS lognormal-on-comp forms).
