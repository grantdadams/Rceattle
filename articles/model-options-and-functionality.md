# 0. Model options and functionality

This vignette is an overview of the parameterization choices and
capabilities available in `Rceattle`. It complements:

- vignette 1, [Rceattle: An
  Introduction](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/articles/introduction.md),
  which walks through fitting a model end-to-end;
- vignette 8, [Model
  parameterizations](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/articles/model-parameterizations.md),
  the equation-level reference (in progress); and
- the per-topic vignettes 3 (diagnostics), 4 (projections / reference
  points), 5 (single- vs. multi-species), 6 (building a data object in
  R), and 7 (Stock Synthesis migration).

If you’re building a new application, this is the menu of options you
choose between when configuring `data_list` and the arguments to
[`fit_mod()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/fit_mod.md).

## 1. Model dimensions and operating mode

> Equations: see vignette 8 [§Population
> dynamics](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/articles/model-parameterizations.html#population-dynamics).

The top-level switches that decide the observation model live on the
`data_list` and the population model and estimation switches live on the
call to
[`fit_mod()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/fit_mod.md):

| Switch | Where set | Role |
|----|----|----|
| `nspp`, `nages`, `nsex`, `nlengths` | `data_list` | Population structure |
| `styr`, `endyr`, `projyr` | `data_list` | Time horizon (hindcast + projection) |
| `msmMode` | [`fit_mod()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/fit_mod.md) | Single- vs. multi-species |
| `initMode` | [`fit_mod()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/fit_mod.md) | Initial age structure |
| `estimateMode` | [`fit_mod()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/fit_mod.md) | Estimate / project / debug |
| `random_rec`, `random_q`, `random_sel` | [`fit_mod()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/fit_mod.md) | Random-effects toggles |

### `msmMode` — single-species vs. multi-species

| Value | Meaning | Status |
|:--:|----|----|
| `0` | Single-species (M = M1 only) | Validated |
| `1` | Multi-species, MSVPA Type II predation | Validated |
| `2` | Multi-species, MSVPA Type III predation | Validated |
| `3:9` | Kinzey & Punt (2009) functional responses (Holling I/II/III, predator interference, predator preemption, Hassell-Varley, Ecosim) | **Blocked** — [`data_check()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/data_check.md) will refuse these until they are validated against the current parameter set |

### `initMode` — initial age structure

Codes (also accept the string aliases listed):

| Value | Alias | Description |
|:--:|----|----|
| `0` | `"FreeParams"` | Initial N-at-age estimated as free parameters |
| `1` | `"Equilibrium"` | Unfished equilibrium, no init devs, F_(init) = 0 |
| `2` (default) | `"NonEquilibrium"` | Unfished equilibrium with initial deviations |
| `3` | `"FishedNonEquilibrium"` | Fished non-equilibrium with init devs; F_(init) is added to M inside geometric series |
| `4` | `"FishedNonEquilibriumScaled"` | Fished non-equilibrium with init devs and R₀-scaled by F_(init) |
| `5` | `"OffsetEquilibrium"` | Unfished equilibrium, F_(init) = 0, displaced by the year-1 recruitment deviation instead of sitting at R_(init); init devs off, no init-dev penalty (Cole Monnahan / AFSC GOA pollock convention) |

### `estimateMode` — what does `fit_mod()` actually do?

| Value | Behavior |
|:--:|----|
| `0` | Estimate hindcast and projection parameters via `nlminb` / [`TMB::sdreport`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/TMB/man/sdreport.html) (default). |
| `1` | Estimate only the hindcast parameters via `nlminb` / [`TMB::sdreport`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/TMB/man/sdreport.html). |
| `2` | Hold the hindcast fixed and run only the projection under the supplied `HCR`. |
| `3` | Evaluate the report once at `inits` (debug / mapping check). |
| `4` | Run through `MakeADFun` and `nlminb` with all parameters mapped out (debug / mapping check). |

### Random-effects toggles

`random_rec`, `random_q`, and `random_sel` move log-recruitment, the
log-catchability deviations, and the time-varying selectivity
deviations, respectively, from penalized fixed effects to random
effects. The deviations are marginalized via the Laplace approximation,
and their distribution parameters are estimated.

## 2. Predation: `suitMode` (per predator)

> Equations: see vignette 8 [§Predation
> sub-model](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/articles/model-parameterizations.html#predation-sub-model)
> (suitability, predation mortality, consumption / bioenergetics).

`suitMode` chooses how prey preference is modeled. Length 1 (same for
all predators) or length `nspp`.

| Value | String | Description | Available? |
|:--:|----|----|:--:|
| `0` | `"Empirical"` | Empirical proportions from observed stomach data (MSVPA-style; Holsman et al. 2015) | Yes |
| `1` | `"GammaLength"` | Gamma suitability on prey length-at-age | **Not yet** |
| `2` | `"GammaWeight"` | Gamma suitability on prey weight-at-age | Yes |
| `3` | `"LognormalLength"` | Log-normal suitability on prey length-at-age | **Not yet** |
| `4` | `"LognormalWeight"` | Log-normal suitability on prey weight-at-age | Yes |
| `5` | `"NormalLength"` | Normal suitability on prey length-at-age | **Not yet** |
| `6` | `"NormalWeight"` | Normal suitability on prey weight-at-age | Yes |

Suitability is averaged across years `suit_styr:suit_endyr` (defaults to
the full hindcast) if year-specific diet data are not included
(e.g. `Year = 0` in `diet_data`). Per-predator `suitMode` allows mixing
parametric and empirical suitability across species.

## 3. Selectivity (per fleet)

> Equations: see vignette 8 [§Selectivity
> parameterizations](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/articles/model-parameterizations.html#selectivity-parameterizations).

Set the `Selectivity` column of `fleet_control` to one of the values
below (integers or strings both work):

| Value | String | Notes |
|:--:|----|----|
| `0` | `"Fixed"` | Selectivity supplied via the `emp_sel` data sheet |
| `1` | `"Logistic"` | Two-parameter ascending logistic |
| `2` | `"NonParametric"` | Age- or length-bin-indexed; penalties via `Sel_curve_pen1` / `Sel_curve_pen2` |
| `3` | `"DoubleLogistic"` | Dome-shaped (ascending + descending logistic) |
| `4` | `"DescendingLogistic"` | Descending only |
| `5` | `"Hake"` | Non-parametric à la Taylor et al. (Pacific hake) |
| `6` | `"2DAR1"` | 2D AR(1) bin × year (Cheng et al. 2024) |
| `7` | `"3DAR1"` | 3D AR(1) bin × year × cohort |
| `8` | `"DoubleNormal"` | Six-parameter double normal (Stock Synthesis pattern 24) |
| `9` | `"NonParametricPM"` | Ianelli non-parametric with the ADMB AMAK (“pm”) penalty; see `Sel_avgsel_pen`, `Sel_cap_bin` |
| `11` | `"LogisticPM"` | AMAK (“pm”) logistic: multiplicative inflection/slope deviations plus a free age-1 log-selectivity |

There is no `10`: the integer codes are frozen, because renumbering one
would silently reinterpret every saved config and every fitted `.rds`
that carries it.

The AR(1) forms reuse the `Sel_curve_pen` columns as logit-scale
correlations, one per dimension: `Sel_curve_pen1` across selectivity
**bins** (ages or length bins, per `Selectivity_dimension`),
`Sel_curve_pen2` across **years**, and `Sel_curve_pen3` across
**cohorts** for `3DAR1`. Before 5.9.0 the 2DAR1 density applied these
two the wrong way round, so a fit that started from unequal
`Sel_curve_pen1` / `Sel_curve_pen2` — or that warm-starts from `inits`
produced by an earlier version — begins from a mirrored point. Refit
from `inits = NULL`, or transpose the two, when moving a 2DAR1 model
across that boundary. Fits that start both correlations at 0 are
unaffected:
[`TMBphase()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/TMBphase.md)
holds them there, and only the two reported estimates exchange names.

Time-varying behavior is set by `Time_varying_sel` (per fleet):

| Value | String | Behavior |
|:--:|----|----|
| `0` | `"Off"` | Time-invariant |
| `1` | `"IID"` | Independent annual deviations |
| `2` | `"AR1"` | **Removed in 5.16.0** – [`data_check()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/data_check.md) errors on it. It was never an AR1: the model scored it with the same independent normal penalty as `"IID"`, and the selectivity deviations carry no correlation parameter. Set `"IID"` for the fit it actually gave, or see the replacement below. |
| `3` | `"Block"` | Time block |
| `4` | `"RandomWalk"` | Random walk |
| `5` | `"RandomWalkAscending"` | Random walk on ascending portion of double logistic |

Not every mode applies to every selectivity form, because the model only
scores a deviation where it defines a density for it:

| Selectivity | Modes accepted |
|----|----|
| `Logistic`, `DoubleLogistic`, `DescendingLogistic`, `DoubleNormal` | `Off`, `IID`, `Block`, `RandomWalk`; `RandomWalkAscending` on `DoubleLogistic` and `DoubleNormal` |
| `NonParametric` | `Off`, `IID`, `RandomWalk` |
| `NonParametricPM` | `Off`, `RandomWalk` — its deviates *are* the walk increments, so `IID` would describe a different curve than the model builds |
| `Hake` | `Off`, `IID` |
| `2DAR1`, `3DAR1` | none — the field carries its own correlations and sd through `Sel_curve_pen` |

The two non-parametric modes differ in what they are a deviation *of*.
`"IID"` scores each annual coefficient deviation about an estimated base
curve; `"RandomWalk"` scores the year-to-year change in the *realized*
selectivity, which is renormalized to mean 1 within each year.

**Neither is integrated out by default, and
[`fit_mod()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/fit_mod.md)
refuses `random_sel = TRUE` on both** — fit them with
`random_sel = FALSE`, the penalized formulation the AMAK model intends.
The walk’s density says nothing about the level of a year’s
coefficients, so those directions are improper and the deviation
standard deviation collapses to zero. The IID density is proper, but the
shape penalty beside it (`Sel_curve_pen1`) is one-sided, so the Laplace
objective is only piecewise smooth and the optimizer stops at a kink
rather than an optimum. Setting `Sel_curve_pen1 = 0` removes that
penalty and makes the IID deviates integrable against the curvature
penalty alone.

One caveat if you do integrate them: the AMAK `avgsel` term is charged
on the integrated deviates as well, so the prior actually integrated is
the IID normal *times* that penalty. It does not scale with
`Time_varying_sel_sd`, so it biases the estimated sd low — measured at
about 5% of the precision at sd 0.35, more as the sd grows.

The switch is **soft-deprecated as a whole**, and
[`data_check()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/data_check.md)
says so on use. The linkage grammar expresses the same IID, random-walk
and AR(1) deviations — `(1 | Year)`, `rw(1 | Year)`, `ar1(1 | Year)` —
per selectivity *parameter* rather than per fleet, and additionally lets
the deviation standard deviation be estimated, given a prior, or held
fixed:

``` r

build_selectivity(linkages = list(
  inf_asc = linkage_spec(~ ar1(1 | Year), by = ~ fleet)))
```

Name whichever parameter should vary: `slp_asc`, `inf_asc`, `slp_desc`,
`inf_desc`, or a `DoubleNormal` alias. The GOA pollock 2025 assessment
runs that way.

Bin indexing: with non-parametric and AR(1) forms, selectivity is
indexed over `N_sel_bins`.

Selectivity can be normalized relative to a specific age by setting
`Sel_norm_bin != NA` or to the max (non-differentiable) by setting
`Sel_norm_bin < 0`. Selectivity can also be normalized relative to the
average across an age-range by specifying the lower (`Sel_norm_bin`) and
upper (`Sel_norm_bin_upper`) bound.

`Sel_norm_bin` is a bin index on the fleet’s own
`Selectivity_dimension`: an absolute **age** for an age-based fleet (`6`
means age 6, not the sixth bin) or a 1-based **length-bin ordinal** for
a length-based one.

### Sharing a selectivity between fleets

Fleets given the same `Selectivity_index` share one selectivity
parameter block, and the penalties and priors on it are accumulated
once, on the group’s first non-`Off` fleet.

Sharing the parameters is not sufficient on its own. The columns that
shape the curve are read **per fleet**, so they have to agree across the
group or the fleets end up with different selectivities:

| Column | If it differs within the group |
|----|----|
| `Selectivity`, `Selectivity_dimension`, `Bin_first_selected`, `N_sel_bins`, `Sel_norm_bin`, `Sel_norm_bin_upper`, `Sel_norm_scope`, `Sel_cap_bin` | The fleets get **different curves** — mirroring fails |
| `Time_varying_sel` | Resolved to the lead fleet’s setting |
| `Sel_start_year` | Resolved to the group’s earliest year |
| `Time_varying_sel_sd` | Honoured per fleet while it is **fixed**. Under `random_sel = TRUE` the group estimates one deviation sd, and TMB averages the initial values of parameters mapped together — this one on the log scale, so the group starts at the *geometric* mean of its estimated members’ values and no fleet keeps its own. [`build_map()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/build_map.md) warns |

A blank counts as a value in the first row: a blank `Sel_norm_bin` means
“do not normalize”, which is a different curve from normalizing at a
bin.
[`data_check()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/data_check.md)
warns in all three cases, distinguishing divergence from resolution.

The reliable way to mirror a fleet is to copy its `fleet_control` row
and change only the identity and catchability columns:

``` r

mirror <- fleet_control[fleet_control$Fleet_name == "Fishery", ]
mirror$Fleet_name         <- "Fishery_CPUE"
mirror$Fleet_code         <- nrow(fleet_control) + 1L
mirror$Fleet_type         <- "Survey"
mirror$Catchability_index <- mirror$Fleet_code
fleet_control <- rbind(fleet_control, mirror)
```

### Sex structure and relative selectivity

Populations are modelled as one or two sexes via `nsex`. **Every
selectivity form is sex-specific by default** when a species has two
sexes: each sex gets its own free copy of every selectivity parameter,
for all forms.

What differs between configurations is the *relative* scale between the
sexes — whether males and females can be selected at genuinely different
levels, or only with different shapes. Normalization makes two
independent decisions, carried by two columns:

- **`Sel_norm_bin` — where the reference is taken.** `NA` normalizes
  nothing; `>= 0` takes it at that bin (or, with `Sel_norm_bin_upper`,
  the mean over that range); `< 0` takes it at the curve’s maximum over
  bins.
- **`Sel_norm_scope` — whose scale it sets.** `"AcrossSexes"` (default)
  pools one reference over the sexes, so the less-selected sex stays
  below 1 and **relative sex-specific selectivity is retained**.
  `"WithinSex"` divides each sex by its own reference, so both reach 1
  and only the *shape* differs by sex.

| `Sel_norm_bin` | `Sel_norm_scope` | Result |
|----|----|----|
| `NA` | — | nothing normalized; the relative scale is free |
| `< 0` | `"AcrossSexes"` | maximum over bins **and sexes** — one sex peaks at 1, the other keeps its relative level |
| `< 0` | `"WithinSex"` | each sex scaled at **its own plateau**, wherever that falls |
| `>= 0` | `"AcrossSexes"` | anchored at that bin, sexes kept comparable |
| `>= 0` | `"WithinSex"` | both sexes forced to 1 at that bin; only the shape differs |

For strongly dimorphic stocks the relative sex selectivity is usually
the quantity of interest, so the `"AcrossSexes"` default is the one to
keep. If instead the sexes plateau at different ages and you want each
scaled at its own plateau, use `Sel_norm_bin < 0` with
`Sel_norm_scope = "WithinSex"` — that is more robust than naming a bin,
since a named bin stops being the plateau once selectivity is
time-varying while the maximum tracks it.

Note that `Sel_norm_scope` has no effect on a one-sex species, or where
`Sel_norm_bin` is `NA`. Before Rceattle 5.8.0 a named bin always implied
`"WithinSex"` and max-normalization always implied `"AcrossSexes"`; a
two-sex fleet normalizing at a named bin should set
`Sel_norm_scope = "WithinSex"` explicitly to keep its old behaviour.

Two things constrain what is actually estimable:

- **The composition data must be joint.** `comp_data$Sex = 3` stacks
  female and male composition into a single vector that is normalized to
  sum to 1 as a whole (as Stock Synthesis does), so the sex ratio is fit
  and the relative selectivity is informed. `Sex = 1` or `2` put each
  sex in its own row, each summing to 1 independently — those carry
  **no** sex-ratio information, and `Sel_norm_bin` then makes no
  difference however it is set. There is no separate sex-ratio
  likelihood component.
- **`Selectivity = "Hake"` always normalizes within sex**, regardless of
  `Sel_norm_bin`, so relative sex selectivity is unavailable with that
  form.

Related settings elsewhere: the sex ratio at recruitment is **fixed
input**, not estimated — it comes from the `sex_ratio` sheet at the
first modelled age. Sex-specific natural mortality is
`build_M1(M1_model = )` (§7) and sex-specific growth is
[`build_growth()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/build_growth.md)
(§8). The per-sex hooks in the linkage grammar are
`linkage_spec(by = ~ sex)` and its `sex =` filter.

Note that `fleet_control` also carries a `Sex` column. It is **inert** —
read nowhere in the model — and is retained only so older workbooks
still read. Sex is set per observation on `comp_data`, not per fleet.

## 4. Catchability (per fleet)

> Equations: see vignette 8 [§Catchability
> parameterizations](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/articles/model-parameterizations.html#catchability-parameterizations).

Set the `Catchability` column of `fleet_control`:

| Value | String | Description |
|:--:|----|----|
| `0` | `"Fixed"` | q supplied directly |
| `1` | `"Estimated"` | q estimated as a free parameter |
| `2` | `"Estimated-with-prior"` | Estimated with a Normal prior |
| `3` | `"Analytical"` | Closed-form analytical q (concentrated likelihood) |
| `4` | `"PowerEquation"` | Power-function catchability (q · B^(α)). **Not implemented** – [`data_check()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/data_check.md) rejects it. |
| `5` | `"Environmental"` | q linked to an environmental index. **Deprecated in 4.9.0** (recorded in the 5.8.1 notes) – express it as a covariate linkage instead: `build_catchability(linkages = list(q = linkage_spec(~ temp, by = ~ fleet)))`. The series is named by `Time_varying_q`, not `Catchability_index`. |
| `6` | `"AR1"` | **Removed in 5.12.0** – [`data_check()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/data_check.md) errors on it. It never worked: the log-q deviates were gated on `Time_varying_q`, which under this form holds an `env_data` column index rather than a mode, so q came back constant. Express the Rogers et al. (2024) form as a q linkage instead – see below. |
| `7` | `"AnalyticalArith"` | q solved from the fleet’s own index observations using the AMAK arithmetic-mean estimator; pair with `Index_distribution = "MVN"` for a supplied covariance |

### Index likelihood (`Index_distribution`)

How an index observation is scored, per fleet. This is the one switch
whose choice also changes how residuals and plots are computed, so it is
worth setting deliberately rather than inheriting.

| Value | String | Scale | Description |
|:--:|----|----|----|
| `0` | `"Lognormal"` | log | Independent lognormal on `log(obs)`. The historical default. `Log_sd` is a log-scale CV. |
| `1` | `"MVN"` | natural | The AMAK/`ebswp` `DoCovBTS = 1` bare quadratic form `0.5 · r' Σ⁻¹ r` on the residual `obs − q·pred`. Drops the normalizing constant, so the reported value matches ADMB. Needs `index_cov`. |
| `2` | `"MVNORM"` | natural | The full multivariate-normal negative log-density. Identical fit to `"MVN"` (the extra term is constant), but properly normalized. Needs `index_cov`. |
| `3` | `"Normal"` | natural | Normal on `obs − q·pred`, with `Log_sd` read as an **absolute** natural-scale sd, not a CV. No lognormal bias correction. |
| `4` | `"TruncatedNormal"` | natural | The same normal, left-truncated at zero. An index cannot be negative, so this is the only natural-scale family whose simulator and likelihood are the same distribution. **Prefer it over `"Normal"`** unless you need an exact ADMB comparison. |

The `MVN` families take a user-supplied variance-covariance matrix
(e.g. a VAST-derived Σ) through `index_cov`, and pair naturally with
`Catchability = "AnalyticalArith"` for the AMAK arithmetic-mean q.

**A family’s scale is recorded in two places.** Adding one to
`index_distribution_map` is not enough: it must also be classified in
`.index_rows_natural_scale()`, which is what
`residuals(type = "pearson")`,
[`plot_index()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/plot_index.md)’s
observation interval and
[`plot_indexresidual()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/plot_indexresidual.md)
read. A natural-scale family that misses it does not error – it silently
gets the log-scale formula, whose `σ²/2` term is then a number the size
of the index squared.

Time-varying behavior is set by `Time_varying_q` (per fleet):

| Value | String | Behavior |
|:--:|----|----|
| `0` | `"Off"` | Time-invariant |
| `1` | `"IID"` | Independent annual deviations |
| `2` | `"AR1"` | **Removed in 5.16.0** – [`data_check()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/data_check.md) errors on it. It was never an AR1: the model scored it with the same independent normal penalty as `"IID"`, and `index_q_rho` belongs to the removed `Catchability = "AR1"` form, not to this switch. Set `"IID"` for the fit it actually gave, or see the replacement below. |
| `3` | `"Block"` | Time block |
| `4` | `"RandomWalk"` | Random walk |

`Time_varying_q` is **soft-deprecated as a whole**, as
`Time_varying_sel` is, and
[`data_check()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/data_check.md)
says so on use. The linkage grammar expresses the same IID, random-walk
and AR(1) deviations, and additionally lets the deviation standard
deviation be estimated, given a prior, or held fixed:

``` r

build_catchability(linkages = list(
  q = linkage_spec(~ ar1(1 | Year), by = ~ fleet)))
```

The removed `Catchability = "AR1"` (QAR1, Rogers et al. 2024) is the
same formula plus the series the deviations are *observed* against —
that is what makes it the state-space form rather than a free AR(1) on
q:

``` r
build_catchability(linkages = list(
  q = linkage_spec(~ ar1(1 | Year), by = ~ fleet, fleet = <Fleet_code>,
                   observe = "<that fleet's env_data column>",
                   obs_sd  = <its measurement SD>)))
```

`obs_sd` is that series’ measurement standard deviation, which the old
switch never asked for. GOA pollock 2025 is a worked example.

If `Catchability` is `AR1` or `Environmental`, `Time_varying_q` can be
an integer or character of integers specifying the environmental series
in `env_data` to use (e.g. `Time_varying_q = 1` or
`Time_varying_q = "1,2,3"`).

### Which fleets get a catchability

Catchability follows the **data**, not the fleet type. A fleet is given
a q if it carries `index_data` the model fits — a fishery with a CPUE
series as much as a survey. A fishery’s index is predicted from that
fishery’s own selectivity, which is what CPUE should share; an index
needing a *different* selectivity has to be its own fleet, since
`sel_at_age` is one block per fleet (the same is true of
`Observation_units`).

A fleet with no fitted index rows gets **no** q, whatever `Catchability`
says — a catchability with no index to inform it is a flat direction in
the likelihood. This applies to a composition-only survey exactly as it
does to an ordinary fishery.
[`print()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/print.html) marks the case so the
column does not read as authoritative:

    [2] Fishery │ Fishery │ sel: Logistic │ q: Estimated (fixed: no index data)

The exception is sharing. Fleets with the same `Catchability_index`
share one q parameter, so the group can only hold one answer to “is it
estimated?”, and the **lead** fleet — the group’s first non-`Off` fleet
— decides for all of them, regardless of type. A fleet with no index of
its own is therefore still estimated if its group’s lead is, and a fleet
whose own `Catchability` is `"Estimated"` is still fixed if its lead is
`"Fixed"`. Give a fleet its own `Catchability_index` when it should be
estimated independently.

The exception is `"Analytical"` and `"AnalyticalArith"`, which solve q
from each fleet’s own index observations rather than from the shared
parameter. A group containing one does **not** share a catchability —
even when every fleet in it carries the same setting, since each still
solves separately. Give those fleets their own `Catchability_index`, or
use an estimated q for the whole group.

`"Environmental"` *does* share: it rebuilds q from the group’s shared
parameters (`index_log_q`, `index_q_beta`), so the whole group follows
the lead fleet — including when the fleets name different environmental
series in `Time_varying_q`, where the lead’s series is the one used. A
`"Fixed"` lead is a third case: nothing is estimated for the group and
nothing is shared, so each fleet sits at its own `Catchability_init`.
Where a q *is* estimated for the group, its starting value is the mean
of the group’s log `Catchability_init` — TMB averages the initial values
of parameters mapped together — rather than the lead’s; only the prior
centre uses the lead’s.

`Time_varying_q_sd` is shared the same way once it is estimated, which
is `random_q = TRUE` with a `Time_varying_q` of `"IID"` or
`"RandomWalk"`: the group gets one deviation sd starting at the
geometric mean of its estimated members’ values, and
[`build_map()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/build_map.md)
warns when they differ. While the sd is fixed, each fleet keeps its own.
`Catchability_prior_sd` is a prior sd the assessor sets and is never
estimated, so it is always honoured per fleet.

[`data_check()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/data_check.md)
warns on the analytical case, on a `Fixed` lead that leaves fleets on
different inits, and on a `Catchability` or `Time_varying_q` that
differs within a group.

### How an index is timed against mortality

An index is predicted from the numbers its fleet sees, and that depends
on the kind of observation. The model keys this on `Fleet_type`; there
is no column to set.

A **survey** index is a snapshot at the month given in `index_data`:

``` math
\hat{I}_y = q \sum_a s_a\, N_{a,y}\, e^{-(\text{Month}/12) Z_{a,y}}\, w_a
```

A **fishery** index is CPUE, which integrates over the year alongside
the catch. Baranov gives $`C_a = F_a \bar{N}_a`$, and effort cancels the
$`F`$ (since $`F_a = q_e E s_a`$):

``` math
\hat{I}_y = q \sum_a s_a\, \bar{N}_{a,y}\, w_a,
\qquad \bar{N}_{a,y} = N_{a,y}\frac{1 - e^{-Z_{a,y}}}{Z_{a,y}}
```

$`\bar{N}`$ is the mean-numbers term the catch equation uses, and the
one a fishery’s age composition is already built on, so a fleet’s index,
catch, and comps are consistent by construction. `Month` is not read for
a fishery’s index rows.

This affects trend, not just scale, so a constant $`q`$ cannot absorb
it. At `Month = 6`, $`e^{-Z/2}`$ approximates $`\bar{N}/N`$ to within 1%
at $`Z = 0.5`$ but is 9.6% low at $`Z = 1.5`$; at `Month = 0` the
snapshot factor is $`e^0 = 1`$, against $`\bar{N}/N`$ of 0.906 at
$`Z = 0.2`$ and 0.432 at $`Z = 2.0`$. A seasonal fishery needs no
special treatment — its exact window predictor differs from the
year-average by a near-constant factor $`q`$ takes up (1–3% trend error
across $`F`$ 0.05–0.8 for $`M`$ between 0.1 and 0.5, against 29–33% for
a snapshot).

### A snapshot-timed index on a fishery’s selectivity

This is the AMAK/ebswp CPUE form, and what an ADMB bridge needs. Give
the index its own `Survey` fleet and point that fleet’s
`Selectivity_index` at the fishery: fleets sharing a `Selectivity_index`
share one selectivity block, so the index gets the fishery’s selectivity
along with its own `Month` and its own q.

Build the mirror fleet by copying the fishery’s `fleet_control` row —
see [Sharing a selectivity between
fleets](#sharing-a-selectivity-between-fleets) for the columns that have
to agree, and why a hand-authored row can silently get a different
curve.

## 5. Composition likelihoods

Set `Comp_distribution` (or `CAAL_distribution`) per fleet:

| Value | String                                       |
|:-----:|----------------------------------------------|
| `-1`  | `"MultinomialAFSC"` (legacy AFSC convention) |
|  `0`  | `"Multinomial"`                              |
|  `1`  | `"DirichletMultinomial"`                     |

Diet composition uses an analogous switch on the bioenergetics control
sheet: `Diet_distribution = 0` (multinomial) or `1`
(Dirichlet-multinomial).

Conditional age-at-length (CAAL) data go through their own data path and
are weighted via `CAAL_weights` per fleet.

## 6. Recruitment / stock-recruit (`recFun = build_srr()`)

| `srr_fun` | String           | Description                      |
|:---------:|------------------|----------------------------------|
|    `0`    | `"mean"`         | Mean recruitment with deviations |
|    `2`    | `"BevertonHolt"` | Beverton-Holt                    |
|    `4`    | `"Ricker"`       | Ricker                           |

Priors and environmental relationships can be added to stock-functions
via
[`build_srr()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/build_srr.md).
See
[`?build_srr`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/build_srr.md)
for options and
[`vignette("environmental-linkages-and-priors")`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/articles/environmental-linkages-and-priors.md)
for details.

## 7. Natural mortality (`M1Fun = build_M1()`)

### `M1_model` — fixed-effects structure of M1

| Value | String                | Description                              |
|:-----:|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|
|  `0`  | `"fixed"`             | use the input `M1_base` (no estimation). |
|  `1`  | `"sex_age_invariant"` | estimate one `M1_{spp}`.                 |
|  `2`  | `"sex_specific"`      | estimate `M1_{spp, sex}`.                |
|  `3`  | `"sex_age_specific"`  | estimate `M1_{spp, sex, age}`.           |

Priors and environmental relationships can be added to M1 via
[`build_M1()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/build_M1.md).
See
[`?build_M1`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/build_M1.md)
for options and
[`vignette("environmental-linkages-and-priors")`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/articles/environmental-linkages-and-priors.md)
for details.

### `M1_re` — random-effects structure on M1

|     Value     | String           | Description                       |
|:-------------:|------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `0` (default) | `"none"`         | No random effects                 |
|      `1`      | `"iid_age"`      | IID by age, constant over years   |
|      `2`      | `"iid_year"`     | IID by year, constant over ages   |
|      `3`      | `"iid_age_year"` | IID across both year and age      |
|      `4`      | `"ar1_age"`      | AR(1) by age, constant over years |
|      `5`      | `"ar1_year"`     | AR(1) by year, constant over ages |
|      `6`      | `"ar1_age_year"` | 2D AR(1) over both year and age   |

Variance and correlation parameters are species-specific but
sex-invariant. `M1_dev_log_sd` is the AR(1) **innovation** standard
deviation — the marginal is `sigma / sqrt(1 - rho^2)`, as in WHAM. (The
linkage grammar uses the opposite convention:
`linkage_spec(~ ar1(1 | Year), init = ...)` takes `sigma` as the
marginal SD.) `M2_use_prior = TRUE` adds a log-normal prior with mean
`M_prior` and SD `M_prior_sd` on total M (M1 + M2) in multi-species
mode.

Modes `3` and `6` estimate a full age × year deviation field. Before
5.9.0 a map defect gave them one deviation per *year* laid on a stride
pattern instead — 42 free deviations where 882 were meant, on
`GOA2018SS` — so fits in these two modes change. They are also the two
to treat carefully: a free age-by-year mortality field with a single
standard deviation and no prior on M is strongly confounded with
selectivity and recruitment in a single-species assessment. Read
`fit$convergence` and the estimability table before trusting one, and
consider a prior on M. Modes `1`/`2`/`4`/`5` are unaffected — they hold
the deviation constant along one dimension deliberately.

## 8. Growth and weight-at-age (`growthFun = build_growth()`)

### `growth_model` — fixed-effects structure of growth

| Value | String | Description |
|:--:|----|----|
| `0` (default) | `"empirical"` | Empirical weight-at-age supplied via the `weight` data sheet. Forecasts re-use the terminal-year weight schedule. |
| `1` | `"vonBertalanffy"` | von Bertalanffy length-at-age + length-weight allometry (`alpha_wt_len`, `beta_wt_len` on the data control sheet) |
| `2` | `"Richards"` | Sex-specific Richards growth |

Priors and environmental relationships can be added to growth via
[`build_growth()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/build_growth.md).
See
[`?build_growth`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/build_growth.md)
for options and
[`vignette("environmental-linkages-and-priors")`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/articles/environmental-linkages-and-priors.md)
for details.

Time-varying growth is specified through the linkage grammar rather than
a switch of its own —
`build_growth(linkages = list(K = linkage_spec(~ rw(1 | Year))))` puts a
random walk on the von Bertalanffy `k`, and `ar1()` / `(1 | Year)` give
the autoregressive and independent alternatives.

The length-based suitability modes (`suitMode = 1/3/5`) are not yet
enabled; use a weight-based mode (`2/4/6`) for parametric suitability.
When the length-based modes are enabled, prey length-at-age is taken
from the estimated growth model (`growth_model > 0`).

## 9. Harvest control rules (`HCR = build_hcr()`)

| `HCR` | String | Description | Multi-species? |
|:--:|----|----|:--:|
| `0` | `"NoFishing"` | No fishing — estimate hindcast only | Yes |
| `1` | `"CMSY"` | Maximize joint catch across species (option to keep depletion ≥ `Plimit`) | Yes |
| `2` | `"ConstantF"` | Constant F set at `Ftarget` per species | Yes |
| `3` | `"ConstantFSSB"` | F that achieves `Ftarget`% of SB₀ at the end of the projection | Yes |
| `4` | `"ConstantFSPR"` | F_(SPR) at `Ftarget` (NEFSC convention; scale via `Fmult`) | No |
| `5` | `"NPFMC"` | NPFMC Tier 3 SPR-based HCR (`Ftarget`, `Flimit`, `Ptarget`, `Plimit`, `Alpha`) | No |
| `6` | `"PFMC"` | PFMC Category 1 `Ptarget`-`Plimit` ACL with uncertainty buffer around `Flimit` (`Pstar`, `Sigma`) | Yes |
| `7` | `"SESSF"` | SESSF Tier 1 SPR-based HCR | No |

`DynamicHCR = TRUE` switches from static to dynamic SB₀ reference
points. `HCRorder` controls the order in which species F is solved for
iterative multi-species HCRs (e.g. predators before prey). See
[`?build_hcr`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/build_hcr.md)
for more details.

## 12. Plotting

Pop / mortality / fit / predation / biology plots — all named after the
quantity they show: `plot_biomass`, `plot_ssb`, `plot_recruitment`,
`plot_depletion`, `plot_depletionSSB`, `plot_exploitable_biomass`,
`plot_catch`, `plot_f`, `plot_mortality`, `plot_m_at_age`,
`plot_m2_at_age_prop`, `plot_index`, `plot_indexresidual`, `plot_comp`,
`plot_data`, `plot_form`, `plot_b_eaten`, `plot_b_eaten_prop`,
`plot_diet_comp`, `plot_ration`, `plot_selectivity`,
`plot_selectivity_vs_maturity`, `plot_maturity`, `plot_stock_recruit`,
`plot_timeseries`. Most accept a single fitted model or a list of models
with `model_names`.

These are built with **ggplot2** (colorblind-safe Okabe-Ito palette for
discrete series, viridis for continuous ones, `theme_classic`) and
**return the `ggplot` object**, so they print when called interactively
and can be further customized by adding ggplot2 layers
(e.g. `plot_biomass(fit) + ggplot2::ggtitle("My title")`). Pass
`file = "stem"` to also write the figure to `stem_<plot>.png`.

**Shared arguments.** The timeseries plotters (`plot_biomass`,
`plot_ssb`, `plot_recruitment`, the depletions,
`plot_exploitable_biomass`, `plot_f`), the predation plotters
(`plot_b_eaten`, `plot_b_eaten_prop`, `plot_m_at_age`,
`plot_m2_at_age_prop`, `plot_ration`) and `plot_selectivity` take one
common vocabulary, documented together in
[`?"rceattle-plot-args"`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/rceattle-plot-args.md):
`line_col`, `lwd`, `lty`, `alpha`, `species`, `spnames`, `minyr`,
`maxyr`, `incl_proj`, `incl_mean`, `add_ci`, `model_names`, `file`,
`width` and `height`. Each word means the same thing wherever it
appears, but not every plotter takes every one — `incl_mean` is on the
predation plotters, `add_ci` only where the quantity carries standard
errors, and `alpha` only where the figure has a ribbon or a fan. Check
[`args()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/args.html). The other plotters still
take their own arguments.

- `line_col` takes colour names, hex codes, or base-graphics palette
  indices (`line_col = 1`), and `lwd` keeps the base-graphics scale
  where the default `3` is a standard-weight line.
- `line_col` and `lty` supply values for whichever variable the *figure*
  separates by colour or line type — which is not always the model. In
  [`plot_b_eaten_prop()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/plot_b_eaten_prop.md)
  colour separates predators; in
  [`plot_ration()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/plot_ration.md)
  line type separates the sexes. Each function’s help says which. Too
  few colours are recycled, with a warning naming what they coloured.
  Where colour is a magnitude — the year fan in
  [`plot_selectivity()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/plot_selectivity.md)
  — `line_col` gives the ramp anchors, so `line_col = "black"` draws the
  fan in black.
- `species` selects (by index, name, logical mask, or `"all"`, in the
  order given) and `spnames` labels.
- `minyr` and `maxyr` narrow the data, not just the axis, so a panel
  with a free y scale rescales to the window.
- Arguments left over from the base-graphics version — `right_adj`,
  `top_adj`, `mod_cex`, `legend.pos`, `single.plots`, `theta` — are
  still accepted, and ignored, by the plotters that had them; they were
  never added to the ones that did not. Set the equivalent on the
  returned ggplot instead, e.g.
  `plot_biomass(fit) + ggplot2::theme(legend.position = "right")`.

**Display units.** The model works in mt and thousands of fish:
numbers-at-age are in thousands and weight-at-age in kg, so biomass and
SSB come out in mt and recruitment in thousands of fish. The timeseries
plotters rescale to `million mt` and `millions` for the axis, and derive
the recruitment age from `minage` rather than assuming age 1. Supply the
model’s inputs on that convention – catch and index in mt, weight-at-age
in kg – or the axis labels will not describe what is plotted. Pass
`ylab` to override the derived label.

**Confidence intervals.** `add_ci = TRUE` draws a 95% interval. Strictly
positive series take it on the log scale, `exp(log(x) ± 1.96 · sd_log)`,
using the model’s `log_biomass` / `log_ssb` / `log_R` where they exist
and the delta-method identity `sd(log x) = sd(x)/x` where they do not.
The interval is therefore right-skewed and cannot reach zero for a weak
year class or a depleted stock. See
[`?plot_timeseries`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/plot_timeseries.md)
for the full derivation.

[`plot_selectivity()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/plot_selectivity.md)
takes it too, but only on a fit run with
`fit_control(selectivity_se = TRUE)` and only for estimated, age-based
fleets; otherwise it warns and draws none. Selectivity is identified
only up to a scalar, so `Sel_norm_bin` fixes the curve’s level rather
than measuring it: the pinned bin has a standard error of 0 and the band
widens away from it. Quote that anchor with the interval.

The error comes from whichever `sdreport` the fit ends on, and that is
not always the one that estimated the curve. Under
`estimateMode = "Estimate"` with an estimating HCR,
[`fit_mod()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/fit_mod.md)
re-optimizes the projection with every hindcast parameter fixed, so the
standard error of every selectivity is exactly 0.
`estimateMode = "Projection"` estimates no selectivity at all, and
`projection_uncertainty` cannot rescue it. Fit the hindcast alone, or
ask for uncertainty in the projection:

``` r

# Errors from the hindcast fit -- the usual choice for a selectivity figure.
mod <- fit_mod(data_list = data, estimateMode = "Hindcast",
               fit_control = fit_control(selectivity_se = TRUE))
plot_selectivity(mod, add_ci = TRUE, minyr = 2015, maxyr = 2015)

# Or keep the HCR projection and carry the hindcast parameters into it.
mod <- fit_mod(data_list = data, HCR = build_hcr(HCR = 5),
               fit_control = fit_control(selectivity_se = TRUE,
                                         projection_uncertainty = TRUE))
```

[`fit_mod()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/fit_mod.md)
warns when the combination would report zeros, and
[`plot_selectivity()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/plot_selectivity.md)
declines to draw a band that is 0 wide at every age rather than render
it as certainty. Give `minyr` / `maxyr` a single year on a time-varying
fleet: every year drawn gets its own band.

Two further conditions belong with any interval you report:

- **The normalization.** On `Atka2022` the survey pins age 4, and its
  standard deviation runs 0.33, 0.18, 0.12, 0.00, 0.14 over ages 1–5;
  the fishery pins nothing, normalizes to a mean of one, and is flattest
  mid-range instead. Same fit, same data — the shape of the band is a
  property of `Sel_norm_bin`, not of the information in the data.
- **The smoothing.** Under `random_sel = FALSE` the annual deviations
  are penalized rather than integrated, so these are
  penalized-likelihood errors conditional on `Sel_curve_pen1` /
  `Sel_curve_pen2` and on a fixed `Time_varying_sel_sd`. Change the
  smoothing and both the curve and its band move, with nothing in the
  data to arbitrate.

The band is marginal. Selectivity error is strongly correlated with F
and q through the same confounding, so carrying it into a derived
quantity needs the covariance
(`fit_control(getReportCovariance = TRUE)`), not this interval alone.
