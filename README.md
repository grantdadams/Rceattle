# Rceattle

Rceattle: an R package for fitting climate-linked, single- and multi-species age-structured stock assessment models and testing via diagnostics, simulation, and management strategy evaluation.

`Rceattle` implements models in R using Template Model Builder (`TMB`; Kristensen et al., 2015). Data can be supplied via the bundled Excel template or constructed programmatically as an R list (see *Building a data object without Excel* vignette). Capabilities include:

- **Single-species** (`msmMode = 0`) and **multispecies** (`msmMode > 0`) configurations, with one- or two-sex population dynamics
- **One or multiple stocks** can be fit jointly.
- **Multiple fisheries and surveys** with flexible **catchability** and **selectivity** parameterizations (logistic, double-logistic, non-parametric, time-varying, etc)
- **Stock–recruitment** options (Beverton–Holt, Ricker, mean-recruitment, environmentally-driven)
- **Estimable growth** (von Bertalanffy / Richards/ empirical weight-at-age)
- **Environmental linkages and priors** on recruitment, natural mortality, and growth parameters
- **Bioenergetics-based predation** with input or temperature-specific consumption (multispecies mode)
- **Forward projections** under alternative **harvest control rules** and climate scenarios
- **Closed-loop MSE**, **retrospective**, **jitter**, and **simulation testing**
- **Tidy outputs** via S3 methods (`as.data.frame`, `coef`, `logLik`, `vcov`, `residuals`, `plot`)

See `browseVignettes("Rceattle")` or the [package website](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/) for full documentation.


**Installation**

```r
# Rceattle (pulls CRAN dependencies automatically)
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("grantdadams/Rceattle")

# Optional: TMBhelper provides richer optimization diagnostics.
# Rceattle falls back to plain nlminb + sdreport if it's not installed.
# devtools::install_github("kaskr/TMB_contrib_R/TMBhelper")
```

For operational / management use, pin a specific tagged release rather than
tracking `main`, e.g.:

```r
devtools::install_github("grantdadams/Rceattle@v4.3.0")
```

The maintainer email in `DESCRIPTION` (`grant.adams@noaa.gov`) is the
preferred contact for questions about the package; please open an
[issue](https://github.com/grantdadams/Rceattle/issues) for bug reports
and feature requests so the discussion is publicly searchable.

**Getting started**

*1-species model*

Fit the 2018 Gulf of Alaska pollock model, inspect the fit, and plot it:

```r
library(Rceattle)

# Gulf of Alaska pollock data (1977-2018)
data(GOApollock)
plot_data(GOApollock)

# Fit the hindcast
fit <- fit_mod(
  data_list    = GOApollock,
  estimateMode = 0,                              # 0 = fit hindcast + projection
  fit_control  = fit_control(phase = TRUE)       # optimizer / sdreport / phasing knobs
)

# S3 methods: the fit behaves like an R model object
fit                       # compact print
summary(fit)              # same compact summary
coef(fit)                 # estimated fixed-effect parameters
logLik(fit)               # logLik with df attribute (AIC works)
AIC(fit)
vcov(fit)                 # fixed-effect covariance from sdreport
as.data.frame(fit)        # return data.frame of derived quantities

# Plot dispatcher: pick a panel with `what`
plot(fit, what = "biomass")
plot(fit, what = "ssb")
plot(fit, what = "recruitment")
plot(fit, what = "index")

# Residuals across data sources (long-format data frame)
ix_resid   <- residuals(fit, type = "index")    # log-scale by default
comp_resid <- residuals(fit, type = "comp")     # Pearson, with Age0_Length1
all_resid  <- residuals(fit, type = "all")
```

*3-species model*

Fit a three single-species model jointly to the Bering Sea data:

```r
library(Rceattle)

# Bundled Eastern Bering Sea single-species data (1979-2017)
data(BS2017SS)
plot_data(BS2017SS)

# Fit the hindcast (single-species mode)
fit <- fit_mod(
  data_list    = BS2017SS,
  msmMode      = 0,                              # 0 = single-species
  estimateMode = 0,                              # 0 = fit hindcast + projection
  fit_control  = fit_control(phase = TRUE)       # optimizer / sdreport / phasing knobs
)

# S3 methods: the fit behaves like an R model object
fit                       # compact print
summary(fit)              # same compact summary
coef(fit)                 # estimated fixed-effect parameters
logLik(fit)               # logLik with df attribute (AIC works)
AIC(fit)
vcov(fit)                 # fixed-effect covariance from sdreport
as.data.frame(fit)        # return data.frame of derived quantities

# Plot dispatcher: pick a panel with `what`
plot(fit, what = "biomass")
plot(fit, what = "ssb")
plot(fit, what = "recruitment")
plot(fit, what = "index")

# Residuals across data sources (long-format data frame)
ix_resid   <- residuals(fit, type = "index")    # log-scale by default
comp_resid <- residuals(fit, type = "comp")     # Pearson, with Age0_Length1
all_resid  <- residuals(fit, type = "all")
```

For a multispecies model, set `msmMode = 1`. See the
package vignettes (`browseVignettes("Rceattle")`) for projections,
alternative harvest control rules, MSE testing, model diagnostics, and
non-Excel data construction. For deeper context, see the
[onboarding document](https://github.com/grantdadams/Rceattle/wiki/Onboarding)
and Wiki. The model can be updated following instructions
[here](https://github.com/grantdadams/Rceattle/wiki/Workflow-for-updating-the-Rceattle).
