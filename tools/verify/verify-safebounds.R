# tools/verify/verify-safebounds.R
# Array-bounds check on the TMB model.
#
# The ordinary build sets `safebounds = FALSE` (src/TMB/compile.R), so an
# out-of-range access is a silent read or write into adjacent memory rather than
# an error. That is not hypothetical here: 5.15.0 fixed exactly such a write,
# where `age_hat` / `age_obs_hat` were sized from `comp_obs` and overran it
# whenever `nlengths < nages` -- "Eigen does not bounds-check in a release
# build, so that was a silent write into adjacent memory, not a crash".
#
# It is also the standing explanation for the one CI failure this net exists to
# catch: R CMD check on windows-latest died with exit code -1073741819
# (0xC0000005, an access violation) inside test-selectivity-catchability.R. An
# access violation is memory corruption, not a bad optimum -- a fit landing in a
# different basin gives a huge gradient and a failed sdreport, not a fault.
#
# This harness rebuilds with bounds checking ON and drives the model over the
# configurations most likely to trip it: ragged composition data (a model whose
# length bins and age bins differ, in both directions), joint-sex rows, tail
# accumulation, and the fleet set the crashing test fits. A violation surfaces
# as an R error naming the object, which is the whole point -- attributable
# instead of a mystery segfault.
#
# Slow by construction: every array access is range-tested, and the model does
# millions per objective evaluation. Minutes, not seconds.

#   * Left alone, the next ordinary load_all() would NOT rebuild -- pkgload only

#     later fit would silently use the slow bounds-checked model.
#   * Deleting only the TMB artifacts is worse still. src/Makevars builds the
#     TMB library as a prerequisite of $(SHLIB), so with src/Rceattle.so still
#     present make considers the target current, never re-runs `tmblib`, and
#     load_all() then fails outright on useDynLib(ceattle) -- a broken tree that
#     a plain rebuild does not repair.
#
# So drop the package SHLIB too and rebuild unchecked, leaving things as found.
#
# Not on.exit(): registered at a script's top level it has no function frame to
# attach to and never fires, which is how this script first left a checked .so
# behind. reg.finalizer() on the global environment runs at session end, on a
# normal exit and on an error alike.
