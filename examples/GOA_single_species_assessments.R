# Pollock
data("GOApollock")
# Differences between CEATTLE and SAFE: the SAFE model penalizes the first 7 and last recruitment deviates, while I penalize them all. Besides that its parameterized the exact same.

# Cod
data("GOAcod")
mydata_pcod$pmature[1,2:13] <- 2 # Spawn wt from SS model includes sex-ratio and maturity already, so setting Pmature (age-at-maturity) to 2 to have CEATTLE calculations be the same
# The cod model was  a bit trickier to recreate because of the use of internal age-length estimation/conditional age-at-length and more flexible selectivity parameterization than I currently have set up in CEATTLE. I use the output weight-at-age, mortality, and terminal year age-length-key from SS as inputs into CEATTLE and set age-based selectivity in CEATTLE to be the form that is most similar to the terminal year length-based selectivity pattern in SS. I fit the same index, catch, and length-at-age data as well as marginal age- and length-comp data that the SAFE model doesn't fit. I ignore annual varying selectivity (you could do it in CEATTLE... see meta_data sheet in the Excel file, I just stopped trying after some convergence issues). I ignored the aging error (could add in, but was having convergence problems). I also do not use the Taylor and Methot 2013 recruitment bias correction thats in SS and did not have a 2016 bump in mortality from the blob.

# ATF
data("GOAatf")
# Differences between CEATTLE and SAFE: ATF composition sample sizes and non-parametric selectivity penalties are the same for each sex while they are different in the SAFE model (differences between sexes for both bits are < 5 in the SAFE model. This was a convenience for coding
