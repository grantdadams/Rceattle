abstract = {A. 2010. The importance of predator– prey overlap: predicting North Sea cod recovery with a multispecies assessment model. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 67: 1989– 1997. The overlap between predator and prey is known as a sensitive parameter in multispecies assessment models for fish, and its para-meterization is notoriously difficult. Overlap indices were derived from trawl surveys and used to parametrize the North Sea stochastic multispecies model. The effect of time-invariant and year-and quarter-specific overlap estimates on the historical (1991 – 2007) and predicted trophic interactions, as well as the development of predator and prey stocks, was investigated. The focus was set on a general comparison between single-species and multispecies forecasts and the sensitivity of the predicted development of North Sea cod for the two types of overlap implementation. The spatial –temporal overlap between cod and its predators increased with increasing temperature, indicating that foodweb processes might reduce the recovery potential of cod during warm periods. Multispecies scen-arios were highly influenced by assumptions on future spatial overlap, but they predicted a considerably lower recovery potential than single-species predictions did. In addition, a recovery of North Sea cod had strong negative effects on its prey stocks. The consequences of these findings for management are discussed.},

abstract = {Trophic ecosystem models are one promising tool for providing ecosystem- based management advice. Diet and interaction rate parameters are critical in defining the behavior of these models, and will greatly influence any predictions made in response to management perturbations. However, most trophic ecosystem models must rely on a patchwork of data availability and must contend with knowledge gaps and poor quantification of uncertainty. Here we present a statistical method for combining diet information from field samples and literature to describe trophic relationships at the level of functional groups. In this example, original fieldwork in the northern Gulf of California, Mexico, provides gut content data for targeted and untargeted fish species. The field data are pooled with diet composition information from FishBase, an online data repository. Diet information is averaged across stomachs to represent an average predator, and then the data are bootstrapped to generate likelihood profiles. These are fit to a Dirichlet function, and from the resulting marginal distributions, maximum-likelihood estimates are generated with confidence intervals representing the likely contribution to diet for each predator–prey combination. We characterize trophic linkages into two broad feeding guilds, pelagic and demersal feeders, and explore differentiation within those guilds. We present an abbreviated food web for the northern Gulf of California based on the results of this study. This food web will form the basis of a trophic dynamic model. Compared to the common method of averaging diet compositions across predators, this statistical approach is less influenced by the presence of long tails in the distributions, which correspond to rare feeding events, and is therefore better suited to small data sets.},

@article{Wang2010,
abstract = {In preparation for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) modeling centers from around the world carried out sets of global climate simulations under various emission scenarios with a total of 23 coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models. We evaluated the models' 20th century hindcasts of selected variables relevant to several large marine ecosystems and examined 21st century projections by a subset of these models under the A1B (middle range) emission scenario. In general we find that a subset (about half) of the models are able to simulate large-scale aspects of the historical observations reasonably well, which provides some confidence in their application for projections of ocean conditions into the future. Over the North Pacific by the mid-21st century, the warming due to the trend in wintertime sea surface temperature (SST) will be 1°-1.5 °C, which is as large as the amplitude of the major mode of variability, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). For areas northwest of the Hawaiian Islands, these models projected a steady increase of 1.2 °C in summer SST over the period from 2000 to 2050. For the Bering and Barents seas, a subset of models selected on the basis of their ability to simulate sea-ice area in late 20th century yield an average decrease in sea-ice coverage of 43{\%} and 36{\%}, respectively, by the decade centered on 2050 with a reasonable degree of consistency. On the other hand, model simulations of coastal upwelling for the California, Canary and Humboldt Currents, and of bottom temperatures in the Barents Sea, feature a relatively large degree of uncertainty. These results illustrate that 21st century projections for marine ecosystems in certain regions using present-generation climate models require additional analysis. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

We use a static mass-balance model to evaluate relationships between species in a large marine ecosystem, the coastal Gulf of Alaska, USA. We focus on food web relationships for four case-study species: Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus steno-lepis), longnose skate (Raja rhina), walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma), and squids (order Teuthoidea). For each, we present the species' position within the food web, evaluate fishing mortality relative to predation mortality, and evaluate diet compositions. We find that high trophic level (TL) species, whether commercially valuable (halibut) or incidentally caught (skates), have mortality patterns consistent with single-species assessment assumptions, where fishing mortality dominates natural mortality. However, assessments for commercially valuable (pollock) or incidentally caught (squids) mid-TL species can be enhanced by including food web derived predation information because fishing mortality is small compared with high and variable predation mortality. Finally, we outline food web relationships that suggest how production of species may change with diet composition or prey availability.},

Three conceptual models of network structure, random, small-world, and scale-free, each have different implications for system behavior and tolerance to perturbations. We constructed two food web network models using detailed quantitative information on the stomach contents of 57 predator (fish) species collected during trawl surveys of the Gulf of Alaska between 1981 and 2002. The resulting food webs displayed both small-world and scale-free network properties, suggesting that impacts on one species might spread to many through short interaction chains and that while most food web connections are not critical, a small set of fished species support critical structural connections.

abstract = {Concern about impacts of climate change in the Bering Sea prompted several research programs to elucidate mechanistic links between climate and ecosystem responses. Following a detailed literature review, Hunt et al. (2011) (Deep-Sea Res. II, 49, 2002, 5821) developed a conceptual framework, the Oscillating Control Hypothesis (OCH), linking climate-related changes in physical oceanographic conditions to stock recruitment using walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) as a model. The OCH conceptual model treats zooplankton as a single box, with reduced zooplankton production during cold conditions, producing bottom-up control of apex predators and elevated zooplankton production during warm periods leading to top-down control by apex predators. A recent warming trend followed by rapid cooling on the Bering Sea shelf permitted testing of the OCH. During warm years (2003–06), euphausiid and Calanus marshallae populations declined, post-larval pollock diets shifted from a mixture of large zooplankton and small copepods to almost exclusively small copepods, and juvenile pollock dominated the diets of large predators. With cooling from 2006–09, populations of large zooplankton increased, post-larval pollock consumed greater proportions of C. marshallae and other large zooplankton, and juvenile pollock virtually disappeared from the diets of large pollock and salmon. These shifts in energy flow were accompanied by large declines in pollock stocks attributed to poor recruitment between 2001 and 2005. Observations presented here indicate the need for revision of the OCH to account for shifts in energy flow through differing food-web pathways due to warming and cooling on the southeastern Bering Sea shelf.},

abstract = {Walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) is an important component of the eastern Bering Sea ecosystem and subject to major fisheries. The Oscillating Control Hypothesis (OCH) predicted that recruitment of pollock year classes should be greatest in years with early ice retreat and late blooms in warm water, because more energy would flow into the pelagic (vs. benthic) community. The OCH further predicted that, with pollock population growth, there should be a shift from bottom-up to top-down regu- lation. New data support the predictions that in those years with early ice retreat, more primary production accrues to the pelagic compartment and that large numbers of age-0 pollock survive to summer. However, in these years, production of large crustacean zooplankton is reduced, depriving age-0 pollock of lipid-rich prey in summer and autumn. Consequently, age-0 pollock energy reserves (depot lipids) are low and predation on them is increased as fish switch to age-0 pollock from zooplankton. The result is weak recruitment of age-1 recruits the following year. A revised OCH indicates bottom-up constraints on pollock recruitment in very warm periods. Prolonged warm periods with decreased ice cover will likely cause diminished pollock recruitment and catches relative to recent values. Keywords:},

Scientists are exploring ways to extend the resolution of the biosphere within these Earth system models (ESMs) to include impacts on global distribution and abundance of commercially exploited fish and shellfish. This paper compares different methods for modeling fish and shellfish responses to climate change on global and regional scales. Several different modeling approaches are considered including: direct applications of ESM's, use of ESM output for estimation of shifts in bioclimatic windows, using ESM outputs to force single- and multi-species stock projection models, and using ESM and physical climate model outputs to force regional bio-physical models of varying complexity and mechanistic resolution. We evaluate the utility of each of these modeling approaches in addressing nine key questions relevant to climate change impacts on living marine resources. No single modeling approach was capable of fully addressing each question. A blend of highly mechanistic and less computationally intensive methods is recommended to gain mechanistic insights and to identify model uncertainties.},

abstract = {A framework is outlined for a unified approach to forecasting the implications of climate change on production of marine fish. The framework involves five steps: (i) identification of mechanisms underlying the reproductive success, growth, and distribution of major fish and shellfish populations, (ii) assessment of the feasibility of downscaling implications of climate scenarios derived from Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) models for regional ecosystems to select and estimate relevant environmental variables, (iii) evaluation of climate model scenarios and select IPCC models that appear to provide valid representations of forcing for the region of study, (iv) extraction of environmental variables from climate scenarios and incorporation into projection models for fish and shellfish, and (v) evaluation of the mean, variance, and trend in fish and shellfish production under a changing ecosystem. This framework was applied to forecast summer sea surface temperature in the Bering Sea from 2001 to 2050. The mean summer surface temperature was predicted to increase by 2 C by 2050. The forecasting framework was also used to estimate the effects of climate change on production of northern rock sole (Lepidopsetta polyxystra) through projected changes in cross-shelf transport of larvae in the Bering Sea. Results suggest that climate change will lead to a modest increase in the production of strong year classes of northern rock sole.},

abstract = {A separable catch-age stock assessment model that accommodates predation mortality is applied to the Gulf of Alaska walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) assessment. Three predators are incorporated in the model: arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias), Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis), and Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus). The effect of these predators is examined by defining the predation mortality as a type of fishery. The model is used to quantify changes in the relative fit to the survey, fishery, and predator data when the assumption of constant natural mortality is relaxed. Specifically, we examine the effect of assumptions regarding the functional feeding response, residual naturaly mortality, and uncertainty in predator biomass on stock assessment. Total natural mortality rates (including predation) tended to be higher than estimated from life history characteristics of the stock. Models that did not account for uncertainty in natural mortality underestimated uncertainty in current stock biomass by as much as 20{\%}. Our results indicate that independent estimates of survey selectivity, additional food habits data, and estimates of the feeding responses of predators to different prey densities are all needed to improve our ability to develop stock assessment models that address ecosystem concerns.},

abstract = {The southeastern Bering Sea sustains one of the largest fisheries in the United States, as well as wildlife resources that support valuable tourist and subsistence economies. The fish and wildlife populations in turn are sustained by a food web linking primary producers to apex predators through the zooplankton community. Recent shifts in climate toward warmer conditions may threaten these resources by altering productivity and trophic relationships in the ecosystem on the southeastern Bering Sea shelf. We examined the zooplankton community near the Pribilof Islands and on the middle shelf of the southeastern Bering Sea in summer of 1999 and 2004 to document differences and similarities in species composition, abundance and biomass by region and year. Between August 1999 and August 2004, the summer zooplankton community of the middle shelf shifted from large to small species. Significant declines were observed in the biomass of large scyphozoans (Chrysaora melanaster), large copepods (Calanus marshallae), arrow worms (Sagitta elegans) and euphausiids (Thysanoessa raschii, T. inermis) between 1999 and 2004. In contrast, significantly higher densities of the small copepods (Pseudocalanus spp., Oithona similis) and small hydromedusae (Euphysa flammea) were observed in 2004 relative to 1999. Stomach analyses of young-of-the-year (age 0) pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) from the middle shelf indicated a dietary shift from large to small copepods in 2004 relative to 1999. The shift in the zooplankton community was accompanied by a 3-fold increase in water-column stability in 2004 relative to 1999, primarily due to warmer water above the thermocline, with a mean temperature of 7.3 ??C in 1999 and 12.6 ??C in 2004. The elevated water-column stability and warmer conditions may have influenced the zooplankton composition by lowering summer primary production and selecting for species more tolerant of a warm, oligotrophic environment. A time series of temperature from the middle shelf indicates that the warmer conditions in 2004 are part of a trend rather than an expression of interannual variability. These results suggest that if climate on the Bering Sea shelf continues to warm, the zooplankton community may shift from large to small taxa which could strongly impact apex predators and the economies they support. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The mechanisms determining changes in an ecosystem and their impacts on marine populations are not well established for most species, but the expectations of managers are that these impacts should be accounted for when selecting management strategies. Predation is an important component of ecosystem dynamics, and predator-prey functional responses can be used to represent predation in multi-species population dynamics models. The predators of walleye pollock, Theragra chalcogramma, in the Gulf of Alaska include arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias), Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus), and Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis). Management strategy evaluation is used to examine the impact of changes over time in natural mortality-at-age related to trends in predator abundance on the performance of the current management strategy for the fishery for walleye pollock in the Gulf of Alaska. The current management strategy is evaluated under nine scenarios which capture uncertainty regarding the predator-prey functional relationship and the level of future fishing mortality on the predators. The current management strategy, which ignores the possibility of changes over time in natural mortality, kept the spawning biomass high relative to the target level and had a low risk of fishing mortality exceeding the overfishing limit, due to low catches relative to the total biomass. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Offshore and deepwater spawning flatfish species in the Gulf of Alaska, such as arrow-tooth flounder Atheresthes stomias and Pacific halibut Hippoglossus stenolepis, have juvenile nurseries that are inshore, in bays or at the mouths of bays. Larvae must emigrate from their spawning areas along the continental slope and outer shelf towards shore, in a direction across the prevailing Alaskan Stream. Using a 20 yr time series of data from ichthyoplankton surveys in the Gulf of Alaska, we examine patterns of variability in larval halibut and flounder distributions that may reflect processes resulting in successful recruitment to nursery areas. Several patterns can be observed in these data. Eggs and the smallest-sized larvae are distributed deep in the water column along the outer shelf and slope. Larger larvae tend to be located in the upper water column and farther inshore over the continental shelf. Larger larvae are also associated with deep-sea valleys and troughs that penetrate the shelf. Thus, these topographic features may serve as transport pathways to juvenile nursery grounds. ENSO (El Nino-Southern Oscillation) conditions and warm-year anomalies are linked to recruitment strength of Pacific halibut. Variability in larval transport as related to ENSO and other conditions that enhance onshore advection may play an important role in the recruitment of flatfishes to their nursery grounds. The results of this analysis indicate that larvae of both species are more abundant in coastal areas during El Nino events, and that a higher proportion of larvae are transported inshore during El Nino years.},

MSE was used to assess the performance of the current management strategy and an alternative management strategy (the “dynamic B0” strategy) for the fishery for walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA), when age-1 recruitment was driven by climate. The relationships between age-1 abundance and climate indices (and the uncertainties associated with these relationships) were characterized within an age-structured operating model that was fitted to the data for GOA walleye pollock. Projections into the future were based on the fitted relationships and predictions of those indices from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) models, using the current or the alternative management strategy to determine catch limits. Management performance (the ability to leave the stock close to the management reference level and achieve high and stable catches) deteriorated when age-1 recruitment was forced by climate, although stocks were kept near the reference level on average. In addition, the ability to estimate management-related quantities, such as spawning biomass, deteriorated markedly when recruitment was forced by climate. Performance was sensitive to the choice of IPCC dataset and, in particular, estimation and management performance was poorest (outcomes most variable) for the IPCC datasets that led to the greatest variation in recruitment to the fishery. Although basing management on a “dynamic B0” management strategy led to improved management and estimation performance, the magnitude of the improvement was slight.},

abstract = {Stakeholders increasingly expect ecosystem assessments as part of advice on fisheries management. Quantitative models to support fisheries decision-making may be either strategic (‘big picture', direction-setting and contextual) or tactical (focused on management actions on short timescales), with some strategic models informing the development of tactical models. We describe and review ‘Models of Intermediate Complexity for Ecosystem assessments' (MICE) that have a tactical focus, including use as ecosystem assessment tools. MICE are context- and question-driven and limit complexity by restricting the focus to those components of the ecosystem needed to address the main effects of the management question under consideration. Stakeholder participation and dialogue is an integral part of this process. MICE estimate parameters through fitting to data, use statistical diagnostic tools to evaluate model performance and account for a broad range of uncertainties. These models therefore address many of the impediments to greater use of ecosystem models in strategic and particularly tactical decision-making for marine resource management and conservation. MICE are capable of producing outputs that could be used for tactical decision-making, but our summary of existing models suggests this has not occurred in any meaningful way to date. We use a model of the pelagic ecosystem in the Coral Sea and a linked catchment and ocean model of the Gulf of Carpentaria, Australia, to illustrate how MICE can be constructed. We summarize the major advantages of the approach, indicate opportunities for the development of further applications and identify the major challenges to broad adoption of the approach.},

However, maintaining healthy stocks to provide the maximum sustainable yield on a single-species basis does not ensure that broader ecosystem, economic, and social objectives are addressed. We investigate how the principles of a “pretty good yield” range of fishing mortalities assumed to provide {\textgreater}95{\%} of the average yield for a single stock can be expanded to a pretty good multispecies yield (PGMY) space and further to pretty good multidimensional yield to accommodate situations where the yield from a stock affects the ecosystem, economic and social benefits, or sustainability. We demonstrate in a European example that PGMY is a practical concept. As PGMY provides a safe operating space for management that adheres to the principles of MSY, it allows the consideration of other aspects to be included in operational management advice in both data-rich and data-limited situations. PGMY furthermore provides a way to integrate advice across stocks, avoiding clearly infeasible management combinations, and thereby hopefully increasing confidence in scientific advice.},

abstract = {To anticipate the response of fish populations to climate change, we developed a framework that integrates requirements in all life stages to assess impacts across the entire life cycle. The framework was applied on plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) and Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) in the North Sea, Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in the Norwegian/Barents Seas and European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) in the Bay of Biscay. In each case study, we reviewed habitats required by each life stage, habitat availability, and connectivity between habitats. We then explored how these could be altered by climate change. We documented environmental processes impacting habitat availability and connectivity, providing an integrated view at the population level and in a spatial context of potential climate impacts. A key result was that climate-driven changes in larval dispersion seem to be the major unknown. Our summary suggested that species with specific habitat requirements for spawning (herring) or nursery grounds (plaice) display bottlenecks in their life cycle. Among the species examined, anchovy could cope best with environmental variability. Plaice was considered to be least resilient to climate-driven changes due to its strict connectivity between spawning and nursery grounds. For plaice in the North Sea, habitat availability was expected to reduce with climate change. For North Sea herring, Norwegian cod and Biscay anchovy, climate-driven changes were expected to have contrasting impacts depending on the life stage. Our review highlights the need to integrate physiological and behavioural processes across the life cycle to project the response of specific populations to climate change.},

For example, stock–recruit residuals of gadids (Gadidae) in the Bering Sea were inversely related to those of shelf flatfishes (Pleuronectidae), suggesting that environmental forcing affects these groups in opposite ways. Salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii), and groundfish stocks each showed strong patterns of covariation within these taxonomic groups and within ecosystems, and both salmon and groundfish stocks showed positive covariation between the two ecosystems. However, we found little evidence of covariation between salmon and herring stocks or between these stocks and demersal stocks. Recruitment and stock–recruit residuals in individual stocks did not show a consistent response to known climate regime shifts. However, combined indices of productivity (mostly salmon) and demersal productivity increased in response to the well-documented 1976-1977 climatic regime shift, whereas the 1988-1989 regime shift produced inconsistent or short-lived responses.},

Scientists are exploring ways to extend the resolution of the biosphere within these Earth system models (ESMs) to include impacts on global distribution and abundance of commercially exploited fish and shellfish. This paper compares different methods for modeling fish and shellfish responses to climate change on global and regional scales. Several different modeling approaches are considered including: direct applications of ESM's, use of ESM output for estimation of shifts in bioclimatic windows, using ESM outputs to force single- and multi-species stock projection models, and using ESM and physical climate model outputs to force regional bio-physical models of varying complexity and mechanistic resolution. We evaluate the utility of each of these modeling approaches in addressing nine key questions relevant to climate change impacts on living marine resources. No single modeling approach was capable of fully addressing each question. A blend of highly mechanistic and less computationally intensive methods is recommended to gain mechanistic insights and to identify model uncertainties.},

abstract = {Ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) emphasizes sustainability at multiple levels of organization beyond single target species. Therefore, biological reference points (BRPs) for aggregated groups are required, which optimize yields while preventing overexploitation of individual species. We evaluate the tradeoffs between yield and biodiversity objectives for a wide range of aggregation strategies using multispecies surplus production models and comparing 2 simulated fish communities. We simulated population trajectories with an operating model de tailing predation and competitive interactions for all individual species within each community, and with additional stochastic environmental variability for one community. Species trajectories were then aggregated by functional feeding guild, taxonomy, habitat association, size class, and at the entire community level. We estimated production parameters and BRPs (e.g. maximum sustainable yield, MSY) using a simple assessment model applied to each aggregated time series, then we applied the MSY fishing rates to each simulated community as alternative fishing strategies and compared equilibrium biomass and yield under each strategy. We were able to define multi-species reference points to meet both yield and biodiversity objectives across full system, taxonomic, habitat, feeding, and size-based aggregations. Species complexes were best able to meet both objectives when species with broadly similar productivity, environmental sensitivity and species interactions were aggregated into the complex. The impacts of simulated environmental variability on BRPs were substantial for certain species and aggregates, so including the combined impacts of environmental variation and species interactions in precautionary reference points appears critical to EBFM.},

There was moderate coherence in exceptionally strong and weak year-classes and correlations across stocks. Based on evidence of synchrony from these analyses, we used Bayesian hierarchical models to relate recruitment to environmental covariates for groups of stocks that may be similarly influenced by environmental processes based on their life histories. There were consistent relationships among stocks to the covariates, especially within the Gulf of Alaska and California Current. The best Gulf of Alaska model included Northeast Pacific sea surface height as a pre- dictor of recruitment, and was particularly strong for stocks dependent on cross-shelf transport during the larval phase for recruitment. In the California Current the best-fit model included San Francisco coastal sea level height as a predictor, with higher recruitment for many stocks corresponding to anomalously high sea level the year before spawning and low sea level the year of spawning. The best Eastern Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands model included several environmen- tal variables as covariates and there was some consis- tent response across stocks to these variables. Future research may be able to utilize these across-stock envi- ronmental influences, in conjunction with an under- standing of ecological processes important across early life history stages, to improve identification of envi- ronmental drivers of recruitment.},

Fishing alone explained few GOA biomass trajectories; it was necessary to both estimate specific predator–prey relationships and provide some mechanism for increased production. No single control hypothesis explained all species dynamics simultaneously, suggesting that in the GOA, there is no single main driver of the ecosystem. Furthermore, the alternative control hypotheses implied contrasting sets of predator–prey relationships (estimated functional response parameters).

abstract = {Predation is the largest source of mortality for marine fish and may be an important process in regulating population size. Recent population models have attempted to quantify predation separately from other sources of natural mortality. Building upon such work, a multispecies age-structured assessment model (MSASA) for the Gulf of Alaska was developed, which included arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias), Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus), and walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma). Predation mortality was a flexible function of predator and prey abundances that was fitted to stomach-content data. A proof of concept illustration is presented here, assessing model outputs against a set of single-species models. The MSASA model was able to successfully estimate predation between species and integrate it into total mortality. Significant predation occurred on younger pollock and flounder. Results indicate a significant change in predation over time on pollock as a function of increased arrowtooth flounder abundance. Estimating mortality and other parameters for three species simultaneously is complex, and the advantage of greater biological realism of MSASA comes at the expense of greater uncertainty in parameter estimation.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Climate change is expected to strongly impact Alaskan (USA) marine ecosystems, particularly those of the northern Bering Sea. To understand how climate change may alter predator demand for prey resources, we quantified the relationship between temperature and allometric rates of prey consumption for 3 major groundfish predators: walleye pollock Gadus chalcogrammus, Pacific cod Gadus macrocephalus, and arrowtooth flounder Atheresthes stomias. We contrasted regional patterns in foraging rates of more than 120000 fish collected annually from 1981 to 2011 from the eastern Bering Sea (EBS), Gulf of Alaska (GOA), and Aleutian Islands (AI). From field observations, we estimate that juveniles and adults of each species eat 1.15 to 3.94 and 0.84 to 3.13 times their body weight (BW) yr-1, respectively (i.e. 0.2 to 1.2{\%} BW d-1), with arrowtooth in all 3 regions and adult EBS Pacific cod exhibiting the highest rates. If historical patterns signify future conditions, we estimate that a 2°C projected increase in water temperature would cause 26 and 14{\%} increases in daily rations of adult EBS pollock and Pacific cod, respectively, whereas we predict a 37{\%} decline in the daily rations of EBS arrowtooth. Similarly, we predict that GOA pollock, Pacific cod and arrowtooth rations would increase markedly (70, 34, and 65{\%}, respectively). Although daily ration of AI arrowtooth may increase by 31{\%}, our models predict 41 and 3{\%} declines in AI pollock and Pacific cod rations, respectively. These results portend (sometimes counterintuitively) region- and species-specific shifts in Alaska groundfish predator foraging rates and trophodynamic interactions concomitant with climate change.},

abstract = {Multi-species statistical catch at age models (MSCAA) can quantify interacting effects of climate and fisheries harvest on species populations, and evaluate management trade-offs for fisheries that target several species in a food web. We modified an existing MSCAA model to include temperature-specific growth and predation rates and applied the modified model to three fish species, walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus), Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) and arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias), from the eastern Bering Sea (USA). We fit the model to data from 1979 through 2012, with and without trophic interactions and temperature effects, and use projections to derive single- and multi-species biological reference points (BRP and MBRP, respectively) for fisheries management. The multi-species model achieved a higher over-all goodness of fit to the data (i.e. lower negative log-likelihood) for pollock and Pacific cod. Variability from water temperature typically resulted in 5-15{\%} changes in spawning, survey, and total biomasses, but did not strongly impact recruitment estimates or mortality. Despite this, inclusion of temperature in projections did have a strong effect on BRPs, including recommended yield, which were higher in single-species models for Pacific cod and arrowtooth flounder that included temperature compared to the same models without temperature effects. While the temperature-driven multi-species model resulted in higher yield MBPRs for arrowtooth flounder than the same model without temperature, we did not observe the same patterns in multi-species models for pollock and Pacific cod, where variability between harvest scenarios and predation greatly exceeded temperature-driven variability in yield MBRPs. Annual predation on juvenile pollock (primarily cannibalism) in the multi-species model was 2-5 times the annual harvest of adult fish in the system, thus predation represents a strong control on population dynamics that exceeds temperature-driven changes to growth and is attenuated through harvest-driven reductions in predator populations. Additionally, although we observed differences in spawning biomasses at the accepted biological catch (ABC) proxy between harvest scenarios and single- and multi-species models, discrepancies in spawning stock biomass estimates did not translate to large differences in yield. We found that multi-species models produced higher estimates of combined yield for aggregate maximum sustainable yield (MSY) targets than single species models, but were more conservative than single-species models when individual MSY targets were used, with the exception of scenarios where minimum biomass thresholds were imposed. Collectively our results suggest that climate and trophic drivers can interact to affect MBRPs, but for prey species with high predation rates, trophic- and management-driven changes may exceed direct effects of temperature on growth and predation. Additionally, MBRPs are not inherently more conservative than single-species BRPs. This framework provides a basis for the application of MSCAA models for tactical ecosystem-based fisheries management decisions under changing climate conditions.},

@article{Kristensen2015,
abstract = {TMB is an open source R package that enables quick implementation of complex nonlinear random effect (latent variable) models in a manner similar to the established AD Model Builder package (ADMB, admb-project.org). In addition, it offers easy access to parallel computations. The user defines the joint likelihood for the data and the random effects as a C++ template function, while all the other operations are done in R; e.g., reading in the data. The package evaluates and maximizes the Laplace approximation of the marginal likelihood where the random effects are automatically integrated out. This approximation, and its derivatives, are obtained using automatic differentiation (up to order three) of the joint likelihood. The computations are designed to be fast for problems with many random effects ({\~{}}10{\^{}}6) and parameters ({\~{}}10{\^{}}3). Computation times using ADMB and TMB are compared on a suite of examples ranging from simple models to large spatial models where the random effects are a Gaussian random field. Speedups ranging from 1.5 to about 100 are obtained with increasing gains for large problems. The package and examples are available at http://tmb-project.org.},

abstract = {Understanding mechanisms behind variability in early life survival of marine fishes through modeling efforts can improve predictive capabilities for recruitment success under changing climate conditions. Walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) support the largest single-species commercial fishery in the United States and represent an ecologically important component of the Bering Sea ecosystem. Variability in walleye pollock growth and survival is structured in part by climate-driven bottom-up control of zooplankton composition. We used two modeling approaches, informed by observations, to understand the roles of prey quality, prey composition, and water temperature on juvenile walleye pollock growth: (1) a bioenergetics model that included local predator and prey energy densities, and (2) an individual-based model that included a mechanistic feeding component dependent on larval development and behavior, local prey densities and size, and physical oceanographic conditions. Prey composition in late-summer shifted from predominantly smaller copepod species in the warmer 2005 season to larger species in the cooler 2010 season, reflecting differences in zooplankton composition between years. In 2010, the main prey of juvenile walleye pollock were more abundant, had greater biomass, and higher mean energy density, resulting in better growth conditions. Moreover, spatial patterns in prey composition and water temperature lead to areas of enhanced growth, or growth 'hot spots', for juvenile walleye pollock and survival may be enhanced when fish overlap with these areas. This study provides evidence that a spatial mismatch between juvenile walleye pollock and growth 'hot spots' in 2005 contributed to poor recruitment while a higher degree of overlap in 2010 resulted in improved recruitment. Our results indicate that climate-driven changes in prey quality and composition can impact growth of juvenile walleye pollock, potentially severely affecting recruitment variability.},
