\title{Simulate Rceattle data}
\usage{
sample_rec(Rceattle, sample_rec = TRUE, update_model = TRUE, rec_trend = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{sample_rec}{Include resampled recruitment deviates from the"hindcast" in the projection of the OM. Resampled deviates are used rather than sampling from N(0, sigmaR) because initial deviates bias R0 low. If false, uses mean of recruitment deviates.}

\item{update_model}{Update model dynamics. Default = TRUE}

\item{rec_trend}{Linear increase or decrease in mean recruitment from \code{endyr} to \code{projyr}. This is the terminal multiplier \code{mean rec * (1 + (rec_trend/projection years) * 1:projection years)}. Can be of length 1 or of length nspp. If length 1, all species get the same trend.}

\value{
Rceattle model
}
\description{
Simulates data used in Rceattle from the expected values etimated from Rceattle. The variances and uncertainty are the same as used in the operating model. The function currently simulates (assumed distribution) the following: survey biomass (log-normal), survey catch-at-length/age (multinomial), EIT biomass (log-normal), EIT catch-at-length/age (multinomial), total catch (kg) (log-normal), and catch-at-length/age.
