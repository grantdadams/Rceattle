\usage{
sample_rec(Rceattle, sample_rec = TRUE, update_model = TRUE, rec_trend = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{Rceattle}{CEATTLE model object exported from \code{\link{Rceattle}}}

\item{sample_rec}{Include resampled recruitment deviates from the"hindcast" in the projection of the OM. Resampled deviates are used rather than sampling from N(0, sigmaR) because initial deviates bias R0 low. If false, uses mean of recruitment deviates.}

\item{update_model}{Update model dynamics. Default = TRUE}

\item{rec_trend}{Linear increase or decrease in mean recruitment from \code{endyr} to \code{projyr}. This is the terminal multiplier \code{mean rec * (1 + (rec_trend/projection years) * 1:projection years)}. Can be of length 1 or of length nspp. If length 1, all species get the same trend.}
