}
\arguments{
\item{srr_fun}{Stock recruit function to be used for hindcast estimation of Rceattle (see below). Default = 0}

\item{srr_pred_fun}{stock recruit function for projection, reference points, and penalties to be used for Rceattle (see below) when \code{srr_fun == 0}. It treats treat the stock-recruit curve as an additional penalty onto the annualy estimated recruitment from the hindcast (sensu AMAK and Jim Ianelli's pollock model). If \code{srr_fun > 0} then \code{srr_pred_fun <- srr_fun} and no additional penalty is included.}

\item{proj_mean_rec}{Project the model using: 0 = mean recruitment (average R of hindcast) or 1 = SRR(omega, rec_devs)}

\item{srr_meanyr}{Integer. The last year used to calculate mean recruitment, starting at \code{styr}. Defaults to $endyr$ in $data_list$. Used for MSE runs where mean recruitment is held at the value estimated from the years used to condition the OM, but F is estimated for years beyond those used to condition the OM to account for projected catch.}

\item{srr_est_mode}{Switch to determine estimation mode. 0 = fix alpha to prior mean, 1 = freely estimate alpha and beta, 2 = use lognormally distributed prior for alpha.}

\item{srr_prior_mean}{mean for normally distributed prior for stock-recruit parameter}

\item{srr_prior_sd}{Prior standard deviation for stock-recruit parameter}

\item{srr_env_indices}{vector or single index indicating the columns of \code{env_data} to use in a environmentally driven stock recruit curve.}

\item{Bmsy_lim}{Upper limit for ricker based SSB-MSY (e.g 1/Beta). Will add a likelihood penalty if beta is estimated above this limit.}
