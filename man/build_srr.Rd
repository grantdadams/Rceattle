\details{
\strong{Stock recruitment relationships currently implemented in Rceattle:}

\code{srr_fun = 0} No stock recruit relationship. Recruitment is a function of \deqn{R_y = exp(R0 + R_{dev,y})}. Sensu Alaska, steepness = 0.99.

\code{srr_fun = 1} Beverton-holt stock-recruitment relationship
\deqn{R_y = \frac{\alpha * SB_{y-minage}}{1+\beta * SB_{y-minage}}}. Prior is on alpha.

\code{srr_fun = 2} Beverton-holt stock-recruitment relationship with environmental covariates impacting larval survival rate
\deqn{R_y = \frac{\alpha * e^{X * \Beta} * SB_{y-minage}}{1+\beta * SB_{y-minage}}}. Prior is on alpha.
