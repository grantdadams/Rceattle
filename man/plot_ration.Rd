\arguments{
\item{Rceattle}{Single or list of Rceattle model objects exported from \code{\link{Rceattle}}}

\item{file}{name of a file to identified the files exported by the
function.}

\item{minage}{minage to plot ration (i.e. age "minage"+)}

\item{model_names}{Names of models to be used in legend}

\item{line_col}{Colors of models to be used for line color}

\item{spnames}{Species names for legend}

\item{species}{Which species to plot e.g. c(1,4). Default = NULL plots them all}

\item{lwd}{Line width as specified by user}

\item{right_adj}{Multiplier for to add to the right side of the figure for fitting the legend.}

\item{minyr}{first year to plot}

\item{incl_proj}{TRUE/FALSE include projections years}

\item{incl_mean}{TRUE/FALSE include time series mean as horizontal line}

\item{add_ci}{TRUE/FALSE, includes 95 percent confidence interval}
}
\description{
Function the plots the ration across ages (minage:nages) as estimated from Rceattle. Returns and saves a figure with the ration trajectory. Ration is multiplied by biomass-at-age/sex to get population level estimates
}
