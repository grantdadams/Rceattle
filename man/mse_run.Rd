\title{Run a management strategy evaluation}
\usage{
mse_run(
  om = ms_run,
  em = ss_run,
  nsim = 10,
  assessment_period = 1,
  sampling_period = 1,
  simulate = TRUE,
  cap = NULL,
  seed = 666
)
}
\arguments{
\item{om}{CEATTLE model object exported from \code{\link{Rceattle}}}

\item{em}{CEATTLE model object exported from \code{\link{Rceattle}}}

\item{nsim}{Number of simulations to run (default 10)}

\item{assessment_period}{Period of years that each assessment is taken}

\item{sampling_period}{Period of years data sampling is conducted}

\item{simulate}{Include simulated random error proportional to that estimated/provided.}

\item{cap}{A cap on the catch in the projection. Can be a single number or vector. Default = NULL}
}
\value{
A list of operating models (differ by simulated recruitment determined by \code{nsim}) and estimation models fit to each operating model (differ by terminal year).
}
\description{
Runs a forward projecting MSE. Main assumptions are the projected selectivity/catchability, foraging days, and weight-at-age are the same as the terminal year of the hindcast in the operating model. Assumes survey sd is same as average across historic time series, while comp data sample size is same as last year. No implementation error!
