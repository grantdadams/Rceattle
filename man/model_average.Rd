\title{Model average of derived quantities}
\usage{
model_average(Rceattle, weights = NULL, uncertainty = FALSE, nboot = 10000)
}
\arguments{
\item{Rceattle}{list of Rceattle model objects}

\item{weights}{vector of weights to be used for weighting models}

\item{nboot}{Number of bootstraps taken from asymptotic distribution of MLEs. Default = 10000}

\item{Uncertainty}{TRUE/FALSE Sample uncertainty across derived quantities using weighted bootstrap from the asymptotic  distribution of MLEs}
}
\value{
an Rceattle object with derived quantities weighted by the specified weights. The length of the derived quantities spans the years which overlap across all models.
}
