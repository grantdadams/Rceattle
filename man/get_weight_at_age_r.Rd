\usage{
get_weight_at_age_r(
  nsex_sp,
  nages_sp,
  nlengths_sp,
  nyrs,
  lengths_sp,
  length_at_age,
  growth_matrix,

}
\arguments{
\item{nsex_sp}{Integer. Number of sexes.}

\item{nages_sp}{Integer. Number of age classes.}

\item{nlengths_sp}{Integer. Number of length bins.}

\item{nyrs}{Integer. Number of years.}

\item{lengths_sp}{Vector. Boundaries of the length bins.}

\item{growth_matrix}{Array. 4D array (sex, age, length, year) from get_growth_matrix_r.}

\item{lw_params}{Array. Dimensions (sex, yr, 2).
Params: \link{s, y, 1} is alpha (a), \link{s, y, 2} is beta (b).}
}
\value{
A 3D array of mean weights with dimensions (sex, age, year).
}
\description{
Converts a growth matrix (length-at-age probabilities) into mean weight-at-age
using a length-weight relationship (W = a * L^b).
}
\details{
The function calculates midpoints for length bins to avoid bias.
For the first bin, it assumes the width is equal to the second bin's width.
The final weight-at-age is the expected value across all length bins for that age.
