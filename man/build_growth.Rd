\usage{
build_growth(growth_model = 0, growth_re = 0, growth_indices = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{growth_model}{Vector or scalar specifying growth model (see @description below). 0 = use empirical weight-at-age in "weight" data, 1 = estimate sex-specific von Bertalanffy growth function, 2 = sex-specific Richards model.}

\item{growth_re}{NOT yet implemented! Vector or scalar specifying M1 random effects model. See description (default = 0).}

\item{growth_indices}{NOT yet implemented! vector or single index indicating the columns (excluding Year column) of \code{env_data} to use for environmentally linked growth.}
}
\value{
A list of switches for defining the M1 model
}
\description{
\strong{Growth fixed effects currently implemented in CEATTLE}
\itemize{
\item \code{growth_model = 0} Empirical weight-at-age from data input \code{weight}. Forecasts use terminal year of weight-at-age.
\item \code{growth_model = 1} Sex-specific von Bertalanffy growth.
\item \code{growth_model = 2} Sex-specific Richard's growth.
}

\strong{Growth random effects currently implemented in CEATTLE}

None are currently implemented
