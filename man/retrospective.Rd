\usage{
retrospective(
  Rceattle = NULL,
  peels = NULL,
  rescale = FALSE,
  nyrs_forecast = 3
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Rceattle}{an Rceattle model fit using \code{\link{fit_mod}}}

\item{peels}{the number of retrospective peels to use in the calculation of rho and for model estimation}

\item{rescale}{rescale environmental predictors?}

\item{nyrs_forecast}{Number of forecast years to calculate Mohn's Rho in addition to terminal year}
}
\value{
a list of 1. list of Rceattle models and 2. vector of Mohn's rho for each species
}
\description{
Calculate Mohn's rho and run retrospective peels for an Rceattle model
}
