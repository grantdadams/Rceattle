\arguments{
\item{data_list}{a data_list created from BSAI CEATTLE dat files \code{\link{build_dat}}, prebuilt data_list \code{\link{BS2017SS}}, or read in using \code{\link{read_excel}}.}

\item{inits}{(Optional) Character vector of named initial values from previous parameter estimates from Rceattle model. If NULL, will use 0 for starting parameters. Can also construct using \code{\link{build_params}}}

\item{map}{(Optional) A map object from \code{\link{build_map}}.}

\item{estimateMode}{0 = Fit the hindcast model and projection with HCR specified via \code{HCR}. 1 = Fit the hindcast model only (no projection). 2 = Run the projection only with HCR specified via \code{HCR} given the initial parameters in \code{inits}.  3 = debug mode 1: runs the model through MakeADFun, but not nlminb, 4 = runs the model through MakeADFun and nlminb (will all parameters mapped out).}

\item{niter}{Number of iterations for multispecies model}

\item{msmMode}{The predation mortality functions to used. Defaults to no predation mortality used.}

\item{avgnMode}{The average abundance-at-age approximation to be used for predation mortality equations. 0 (default) is the \eqn{N/Z ( 1 - exp(-Z) )}, 1 is \eqn{N exp(-Z/2)}, 2 is \eqn{N}.}

\item{initMode}{how the population is initialized. 0 = initial age-structure estimated as free parameters; 1 = equilibrium age-structure estimated out from R0,  mortality (M1), and initial population deviates; 2 = non-equilibrium age-structure estimated out from initial fishing mortality (Finit), R0,  mortality (M1), and initial population deviates.}

\item{suitMode}{Mode for suitability/functional calculation. 0 = empirical based on diet data (Holsman et al. 2015), 1 = length based gamma suitability, 2 = weight based gamma suitability, 3 = length based lognormal selectivity, 4 = time-varying length based lognormal selectivity.}

\item{suit_meanyr}{Integer. The last year used to calculate mean suitability, starting at \code{styr}. Defaults to $endyr$ in $data_list$. Used for MSE runs where suitability is held at the value estimated from the years used to condition the OM, but F is estimated for years beyond those used to condition the OM to account for projected catch.}

\item{use_gradient}{use the gradient to phase (default = TRUE).}

\item{rel_tol}{The relative tolerance for discontinuous likelihood warnings. Set to 1. This evaluates the difference between the TMB object likelihood and the nlminb likelihood.}

\item{control}{A list of control parameters. For details see \code{?nlminb}}

\item{loopnum}{number of times to re-start optimization (where \code{loopnum=3} sometimes achieves a lower final gradient than \code{loopnum=1})}

\item{verbose}{0 = Silent, 1 = print updates of model fit, 2 = print updates of model fit and TMB estimation progress.}

\item{newtonsteps}{number of extra newton steps to take after optimization (alternative to \code{loopnum})}

\item{random_rec}{logical. If TRUE, treats recruitment deviations as random effects.The default is FALSE.}

\item{random_q}{logical. If TRUE, treats annual catchability deviations as random effects.The default is FALSE.}

\item{random_sel}{logical. If TRUE, treats annual selectivity deviations as random effects.The default is FALSE.}

\item{HCR}{HCR list object from \code{\link[build_hcr]}}

\item{recFun}{The stock recruit-relationship parameterization from \code{\link{build_srr}}.}

\item{minNByage}{Minimum numbers at age to put in a hard constraint that the number-at-age can not go below.}

\item{M1Fun}{M1 parameterizations and priors. Use \code{build_M1}.}
