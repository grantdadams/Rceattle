fishery types, species, and years.}

\item{catch_ln_sd}{A vector of log standard deviations for catches.}

\item{est_sigma_fsh}{A vector indicating the estimation method for standard deviations.}

\item{jnll_comp}{A matrix to accumulate negative log likelihood contributions.}

\item{F_dev}{A matrix of fishing mortality deviations.}

\item{flt_type}{A vector indicating the type of fishery.}

\item{styr}{The starting year for the analysis.}

\item{endyr}{The ending year for the analysis.}
}
\value{
