  dat_dir = NULL, nspp = 3, nselages = 8)
}
\arguments{
\item{ctlFilename}{The ADMB control (.ctl) file used for CEATTLE}

\item{TMBfilename}{The version of the cpp CEATTLE file found in the /src folder}

\item{cpp_directory}{The directory where the cpp file is found}

\item{dat_dir}{The directory where ctl and dat files are stored}

\item{nspp}{The number of species included in the CEATTLE model. Deafualts to 3.}

\item{nselages}{Number of ages to estimate selectivity. Can either be a single number or vector of length nspp}
}
\value{
A list of data objects used by TMB
}
\description{
Function to build a \code{data_list} object to be used by Rceattle from ADMB based CEATTLE dat and ctl files for BSAI groundfish. The function first reads the TMB .cpp file speciied by \code{TMBfilename} to identify the names of the data objects used by TMB. The function then searches across the \code{.dat} files in the directory specified by \code{dat_dir} to find the location of each data object. The function then reads in the specific data object from the \code{.dat} file and reformats them to be used by TMB.
