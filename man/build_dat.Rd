\item{nspp}{The number of species included in the CEATTLE model. Deafualts to 3.}

\item{nselages}{Number of ages to estimate selectivity. Can either be a single number or vector of length nspp}

\item{proj_yr}{The year to project the populations with no fishing. Assumed to be 2100}

\description{
Function to build a \code{data_list} object to be used by Rceattle from ADMB based CEATTLE dat and ctl files for BSAI groundfish. The function first reads the TMB .cpp file speciied by \code{TMBfilename} to identify the names of the data objects used by TMB. The function then searches across the \code{.dat} files in the directory specified by \code{dat_dir} to find the location of each data object. The function then reads in the specific data object from the \code{.dat} file and reformats them to be used by TMB.
