\details{
\strong{Harvest control rule formulations currently implemented in Rceattle:}

\code{hcr = 0} No catch. Estimate the hindcast.

\code{hcr = 1} Constant F set at \code{FXSPRtarget} for each species (vector or single F)

\code{hcr = 2} Constant catch set at \code{Ctarget}

\code{hcr = 3} The North Pacific Fishery Management Council (NPFMC) Tier 3 spawner-per-recruit-based harvest control rule:
Stock status: \eqn{ SB > SB at FXSPRtarget)}
\deqn{Fofl = FXSPRlimit }
\deqn{Fuse = FXSPRtarget}
Stock status: \eqn{Alpha < SB / SB at FXSPRtarget at  ≤1}
	\deqn{Fofl = FXSPRlimit * (SB / Ptarget - Alpha)/(1-Alpha)}
\deqn{Fuse = FXSPRtarget * (SB/ Ptarget - Alpha)/(1-Alpha)}
Stock status: \eqn{SB/SB at FXSPRtarget ≤ Alpha} or \eqn{SB < Plimit*SB0}
\deqn{Fofl=0}
\deqn{Fuse=0}

\code{hcr = 4} An HCR based on the The Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) category 1 40-10 annual catch limit (ABC) harvest control rule assuming Fofl is normally distributed with a standard deviation (sigma) = 0.5 and an uncertainty quantile buffer (P∗) of 0.45 (PFMC 2020). Target biological reference points are calculated based on the normal cumulative distribution function (Φ(quantile,mean,standard deviation)), P∗, and sigma as follows:
Stock status: \eqn{ SB > SB0*Ptarget)}
\deqn{Fofl = FXSPRlimit}
\deqn{Fuse = Φ(Pstar, FXSPRlimit, Sigma)}
	Stock status: \eqn{SB0*Plimit < SB ≤ SB0*Ptarget}
	\deqn{Fofl = FXSPRlimit}
\deqn{Fuse = Φ(Pstar, FXSPRlimit, Sigma)*{SB0*Ptarget(SB - SB0*Plimit)}{SB(SB0*Ptarget - SB0*Plimit)}}
	Stock status: \eqn{SB < SB0*Plimit}
\deqn{Fofl=0}
\deqn{Fuse=0}

\code{hcr = 5} An HCR based on the The Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF) spawner-per-recruit-based Tier 1 harvest control rule where F_Limit=F_(20\%), B_Limit=〖SB〗_20, F_Target (AFMA 2017) calculated as follows:
Stock status: \eqn{ SB > SB0*Ptarget)}
\deqn{Fofl = FXSPRlimit}
\deqn{Fuse = FXSPRtarget}
Stock status: \eqn{Ptarget > SB > SB0*Plimit}
\deqn{Fofl = FXSPRlimit * (SB / SB0*Ptarget - 1)}
\deqn{Fuse = FXSPRtarget * (SB/ SB0*Ptarget - 1)}
Stock status: \eqn{SB < SB0*Plimit}
\deqn{Fofl=0}
\deqn{Fuse=0}
