\title{Function to fit a dynamic structural equation model related to recruitment}
\usage{
build_DSEM(sem = NULL, family = "normal")
}
\arguments{
\item{sem}{Specification for time-series structural equation model structure including lagged or simultaneous effects. See Details section in \code{dsem::make_dsem_ram} for more description. All variables must be included in and named following variables in \code{env_data}. The default is assumes IID recruitment deviates. NOTE: must include \code{recdevs[spp]} for each species \code{1:nspp} (recdevs1 and recdevs2 for a 2 species model)!}

\item{family}{Character or character-vector listing the distribution used for each column of \code{env_data} used in the \code{sem}, where each element must be fixed (for no measurement error/measured exactly), normal for normal measurement error using an identity link, gamma for a gamma measurement error using a fixed CV and log-link, bernoulli for a Bernoulli measurement error using a logit-link, or poisson for a Poisson measurement error using a log-link. Default is family family="normal".}
}
\description{
The code links dynamic structural equation models to recruitment within Rceattle. The internals of \code{dsem} were copy and pasted into Rceattle. See \code{??dsem} for more description.
