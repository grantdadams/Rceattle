\value{
List containing:
\itemize{
\item catch_hat - Estimated catch by fishery index
\item max_catch_hat - Maximum possible catch by fishery index
}
}
\description{
Calculates catch at age and total yield (in kg or numbers) for each fishery index
}
\details{
The function estimates catch and maximum possible catch for each fishery index.
Calculations are done either by weight or by numbers depending on fleet units.
Separate calculations are made for hindcast and projection periods.
