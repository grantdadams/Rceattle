# Survey catchability over time

Plots the fitted survey catchability `q` by year, faceted by fleet.
Every fleet carrying `index_data` is drawn, a fishery with a CPUE series
as much as a survey.

## Usage

``` r
plot_catchability(
  Rceattle,
  file = NULL,
  model_names = NULL,
  species = NULL,
  spnames = NULL,
  mse = FALSE,
  minyr = NULL,
  maxyr = NULL,
  incl_mean = FALSE,
  log = FALSE,
  line_col = NULL,
  lwd = 3,
  lty = 1,
  width = 7,
  height = 6.5,
  right_adj = 0,
  top_adj = 0.05,
  single.plots = FALSE
)
```

## Arguments

- Rceattle:

  A single
  [`fit_mod()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/fit_mod.md)
  object or a list of them (overlaid).

- file:

  Optional file stem; the figure is written to `<file>_<suffix>.png` if
  given.

- model_names:

  Legend labels for the models.

- species:

  Species to include, as indices (`c(1, 3)`), names, a logical mask, or
  `"all"`. Default `NULL` plots every species. Species **labels** belong
  in `spnames`; a character `species` that matches no species name is
  read as labels for back-compatibility.

- spnames:

  Species labels, length `nspp`. Default: the model's own.

- mse:

  Is `Rceattle` an MSE object? Its operating models are drawn.

- minyr, maxyr:

  First / last year to plot.

- incl_mean:

  Add a horizontal line at the hindcast mean of each series.

- log:

  Plot catchability on the log scale.

- line_col:

  Line colours; names, hex, or base-graphics integers. `NULL` uses the
  colorblind-safe Okabe-Ito palette. Applied to whichever variable the
  figure separates by colour, in legend order. Too few colours are
  recycled, with a warning.

- lwd:

  Line width on the base-graphics scale: the default `3` renders as a
  standard-weight ggplot line. A vector varies it across series.

- lty:

  Line type. A vector varies it across the levels of whatever the figure
  separates by line type.

- width, height:

  Saved figure size in inches.

- right_adj:

  Ignored. Base-graphics leftover: the figure widened its right margin
  to fit the legend. Set margins on the returned ggplot instead.

- top_adj:

  Ignored. Base-graphics leftover; see `right_adj`.

- single.plots:

  Ignored. Base-graphics leftover: one device per panel. The ggplot
  facets instead.

## Value

A `ggplot` object.

## Details

The value plotted is the realized catchability the model scaled the
survey by, whichever route produced it: an estimated or fixed mean,
annual deviations under `Time_varying_q`, an environmental regression
(`Catchability = "Environmental"`), a `q` linkage such as `rw(1 | Year)`
or `ar1(1 | Year)`, or the closed-form value under `"Analytical"` /
`"AnalyticalArith"`. A fleet with a time-invariant catchability draws a
flat line, which is the honest picture of a constant `q` rather than an
empty panel.

**Hindcast years only.** The model carries catchability over the
hindcast and does not project it, so the series stops at `endyr`
regardless of the projection horizon. There is no `incl_proj`.

`line_col` and `lty` separate the **models**, so overlaying several fits
compares their catchability series panel by panel.

## Examples

``` r
# \donttest{
data(BS2017SS)
fit <- Rceattle::fit_mod(data_list = BS2017SS, msmMode = 0)
#> `age_trans_matrix` data does not span range of age for species 1 will fill with 0s
#> Step 1: Parameter build complete
#> Step 2: Map build complete
#> Step 3: Parameter bounds complete
#> Step 4: Data rearrange complete
#> Step 5: Hindcast build complete
#> Step 6: Hindcast optimization complete
plot_catchability(fit)

plot_catchability(fit, log = TRUE)

# }
