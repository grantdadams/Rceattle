# Look up what a CEATTLE parameter is

The TMB parameter vector uses transformed, abbreviated names – `log_M1`,
`R_log_sd`, `index_log_q`. This returns the table mapping each one to
the quantity it represents on its natural scale, which process it
belongs to, what it means, and its dimensions.

## Usage

``` r
parameter_dictionary(internal = NULL, process = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- internal:

  Character vector of internal parameter names, as they appear in
  `names(fitted$estimated_params)` or in an `sdreport()`. Default `NULL`
  returns every parameter.

- process:

  Character vector restricting the table to one or more parts of the
  model: `"recruitment"`, `"mortality"`, `"growth"`, `"fishing"`,
  `"catchability"`, `"selectivity"`, `"observation"`, `"predation"`,
  `"linkage"` or `"internal"`.

## Value

A data frame with one row per parameter and columns `internal`,
`natural`, `process`, `meaning` and `dims`.

## Details

A name beginning `log_`, or ending `_log_sd`, is estimated on the log
scale, so [`exp()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/Log.html) turns it into the
quantity named in the `natural` column. Most fitted values are already
back-transformed in `fitted$quantities`, so this is mainly needed when
reading `estimated_params` or an `sdreport()` directly.

Dimensions use the model's own notation: `nspp` species, `nsex` sexes,
`nages` age bins, `nyrs` years including the projection, `nyrs_hind`
hindcast years only, `n_flt` fleets, `n_fsh` fishery fleets and `n_sel`
selectivity blocks.

## See also

[`fit_mod()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/fit_mod.md)
for the fitted object these names come from.

#> 8 Meaning depends on the fleet's Selectivity. For the non-parametric forms these are weights on the shape and curvature penalties, supplied via fleet_control and not estimated. For '2DAR1' and '3DAR1' the same slots hold estimated correlations: slot 1 across selectivity BINS, slot 2 across YEARS, and for 3DAR1 slot 3 across COHORTS.
