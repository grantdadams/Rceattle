# Look up what a CEATTLE reported quantity is

`fit$quantities` uses the model's own abbreviated names. This returns
the table mapping each one to what it means, the units it is in, how it
is shaped, whether it carries a standard error, and what the same
quantity is called in the NOAA standardized assessment output.

## Usage

``` r
quantity_dictionary(quantity = NULL, process = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- quantity:

  Report names as they appear in `names(fit$quantities)`, default `NULL`
  for every documented quantity.

- process:

  Character vector restricting the table to one or more parts of the
  model: `"population"`, `"recruitment"`, `"mortality"`, `"fishing"`,
  `"reference_points"`, `"catchability"`, `"selectivity"`, `"growth"`,
  `"composition"`, `"predation"`, `"likelihood"`, `"linkage"` or
  `"internal"`.

## Value

A data frame with one row per quantity and columns `quantity`,
`process`, `meaning`, `units`, `dims`, `se` and `standard_label`.

## Details

Units follow the model throughout: numbers-at-age are **thousands of
fish** and weight-at-age is **kg**, so their product is **mt**. A
quantity whose units read `"mt or thousands of fish"` follows its
fleet's `Observation_units` column.

`se = TRUE` means the TMB template `ADREPORT`s the quantity, so
`fit$sdrep` carries a standard error for it and
[`as.data.frame.Rceattle()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/as.data.frame.Rceattle.md)
can fill `se`, `lwr` and `upr`. `se = FALSE` means no standard error
exists anywhere on the fit for that quantity. Nothing has a standard
error when the fit was produced with `fit_control(getsd = FALSE)`, which
leaves `sdrep` NULL.

`standard_label` gives the name the quantity takes in the NOAA
standardized assessment output that `stockplotr` and `asar` consume, so
a table can be relabelled for those tools; `NA` marks a quantity that
standard has no equivalent for. Rceattle's own names are kept as the
primary vocabulary because several quantities (predation, multispecies)
have no standard name.

Every per-recruit reference point (`SPR0`, `SPRlimit`, `SPRtarget`,
`SPRFinit`, `NbyageSPR`) is computed only under `msmMode = 0` and is
exactly **zero on a multispecies fit** – M there carries predation
mortality, which scales with predator abundance, so spawning output per
recruit is not a property of the prey stock alone.
