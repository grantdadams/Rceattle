# Plot the likelihood components across a profile

Draws each negative log-likelihood component against the profiled
parameter, with the total overlaid, in the style of
`r4ss::SSplotProfile()`. Where the curves disagree about which value of
the parameter they prefer, the data sources are in conflict – which is
what the total on its own cannot show.

## Usage

``` r
plot_profile(
  Rceattle_profile,
  model_names = NULL,
  weighted = TRUE,
  relative = c("own", "minimum", "none"),
  minfraction = 0.01,
  add_cutoff = FALSE,
  cutoff = 1.92,
  xlab = NULL,
  ylab = NULL,
  line_col = NULL,
  lwd = 3,
  lty = 1,
  file = NULL,
  width = 7,
  height = 5
)
```

## Arguments

- Rceattle_profile:

  A single `"Rceattle_profile"` from
  [`profile.Rceattle()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/profile.Rceattle.md),
  or a list of them to compare models in facets (e.g. the same profile
  run on two model configurations).

- model_names:

  Legend labels for the models.

- weighted, relative, minfraction:

  Passed to
  [`profile_components()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/profile_components.md).
  `minfraction` defaults to `0.01` here, as in `r4ss::SSplotProfile()`.

- add_cutoff:

  Draw a horizontal line at `cutoff`. Off by default: the cutoff is a
  statement about the total, and drawing it across the components
  invites reading it as one about them.

- cutoff:

  Height of that line. Default `1.92`, the 95% profile-likelihood cutoff
  for one parameter, \\\chi^2_1(0.95)/2\\.

- xlab:

  X-axis label. Default names the profiled parameter and cell in the
  units the grid is in.

- ylab:

  Y-axis label. Default follows `relative`.

- line_col:

  Line colours; names, hex, or base-graphics integers. `NULL` uses the
  colorblind-safe Okabe-Ito palette. Applied to whichever variable the
  figure separates by colour, in legend order. Too few colours are
  recycled, with a warning.

- lwd:

  Line width on the base-graphics scale: the default `3` renders as a
  standard-weight ggplot line. A vector varies it across series.

- lty:

  Line type. A vector varies it across the levels of whatever the figure
  separates by line type.

- file:

  Optional file stem; the figure is written to `<file>_<suffix>.png` if
  given.

- width, height:

  Saved figure size in inches.

## Value

A `ggplot` object. Its `$data` is the plotted frame, so the numbers
behind the figure can be read back off it.

## Details

Read the figure by where each curve bottoms out, not by how deep it is.
Every series is re-zeroed at its own minimum (`relative = "own"`) and a
point marks that minimum, so the spread of the points along the x axis
*is* the disagreement: components whose points sit together support the
same value, and a component whose point sits far from the total's is
pulling against the rest. `relative = "minimum"` instead re-zeroes every
series at the total's minimum, which shows what each component gives up
by moving away from the fitted value.

The total is drawn in black, heavier than the components, and is kept
out of the colour legend so the palette separates only the components
being compared. Components whose change over the grid is under
`minfraction` of the total's are dropped: they are flat on this scale
and would only crowd the legend. Non-converged grid points leave a gap
in the curve.

`line_col`, `lwd` and `lty` apply to the **components**. The total is
drawn solid and black at 1.6 times `lwd`, so that it stays the reference
line whatever the components are styled as. Series are ordered, in the
legend and in the palette, by how much each moves over the grid.

Under `random_rec = TRUE` the total is the Laplace-approximated marginal
likelihood while the components are the inner joint negative
log-likelihood, so they will not sum;
[`profile_components()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/profile_components.md)
says so when they differ. The shapes are still comparable.

## Examples

``` r
# \donttest{
data(BS2017SS)
ss_run <- fit_mod(data_list = BS2017SS, inits = NULL, file = NULL,
    estimateMode = 0, random_rec = FALSE, msmMode = 0, avgnMode = 0,
    phase = FALSE, verbose = 0)
#> Warning: Passing ‘phase’, ‘verbose’ directly to fit_mod() is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Bundle these into fit_control() instead, e.g. fit_control(phase = ..., verbose = ...). Forwarding for now.
#> `age_trans_matrix` data does not span range of age for species 1 will fill with 0s

# Profile M for species 1 and see which data sources disagree about it
prof <- profile(ss_run, param = "M1", slots = list(c(1, 1, 1)),
                values = list(seq(0.2, 0.5, by = 0.05)))

plot_profile(prof, xlab = "M at age 1")


# Two model configurations side by side
plot_profile(list(prof, prof), model_names = c("Base", "Alternative"))

# }
```
