# Assessment reporting tables from one or more Rceattle fits

Collects the quantities a stock assessment reports into one set of tidy
tables, so a SAFE chapter or a model comparison is built from a single
call rather than from a dozen ad-hoc extractions. Every table carries a
`model` column, so passing several fits gives a like-for-like
comparison.

## Usage

``` r
report_tables(
  object,
  model_names = NULL,
  retro = NULL,
  jitter = NULL,
  osa = NULL,
  ci_level = 0.95,
  quantities = c("biomass", "ssb", "R", "biomass_depletion", "ssb_depletion", "F_spp")
)
```

## Arguments

- object:

  An Rceattle fit from
  [`fit_mod()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/fit_mod.md),
  or a list of them.

- model_names:

  Names for the models, defaulting to the names of `object` or to
  `Model_1`, `Model_2`, ...

- retro:

  A
  [`retrospective()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/retrospective.md)
  result per model, or `NULL` (default) to omit that section.

- jitter:

  A
  [`jitter()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/jitter.md)
  result per model, or `NULL` (default) to omit that section.

- osa:

  An
  [`osa_residuals()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/osa_residuals.md)
  result per model, summarized here with
  [`osa_diagnostics()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/osa_diagnostics.md),
  or `NULL` (default) to omit that section.

- ci_level:

  Confidence level for the `timeseries` interval, default `0.95`.

- quantities:

  Time-series quantities to include, from the set
  [`as.data.frame.Rceattle()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/as.data.frame.Rceattle.md)
  accepts;
  [`quantity_dictionary()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/quantity_dictionary.md)
  says what each one means.

## Value

A list of data frames with class `"rceattle_report"`, one element per
section described above. Each carries a `model` column.

## Details

The sections follow the AFSC Alaska Groundfish Stock Assessment
Guidelines for what a chapter reports:

- `model`:

  One row per fit: dimensions, switches, the objective, the number of
  estimated parameters, AIC, the maximum gradient, whether the Hessian
  was positive definite, and the run time.

- `parameters`:

  Every estimated parameter with its standard error, and the
  natural-scale name and process from
  [`parameter_dictionary()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/parameter_dictionary.md).
  Where `sigma_R` and an estimated M are found. Estimates are on the
  parameter's own scale, so a `log_` name needs
  [`exp()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/Log.html); a **fixed** M is not here
  at all, because it was never estimated — read it off `M_at_age`.

- `likelihood`:

  The negative log-likelihood by component and fleet or species,
  weighted and unweighted.

- `timeseries`:

  Biomass, female spawning-stock biomass, recruitment, depletion and
  fishing mortality by species and year, with standard errors and
  confidence intervals, split into hindcast (`era = "time"`) and
  projection (`era = "fore"`).

- `reference_points`:

  The executive-summary quantities: the SPR-based F proxies, unfished
  and target female spawning-stock biomass, the biomass proxies implied
  by `Ptarget` / `Plimit`, and terminal status. A `basis` column says
  whether each was estimated, and if not, why – see below.

- `fits`:

  Observed against predicted index and catch, with the standard
  deviation of normalized residuals (SDNR) per fleet.

- `retrospective`, `jitter`, `osa`:

  Present only when the corresponding object is supplied.

Nothing here refits. The three diagnostics are tens to hundreds of
optimizations each, so they are supplied as already-computed objects
rather than run inside a table-building call; a section whose object is
`NULL` is simply absent from the result.

The standard harvest scenarios of guideline section 4.11.3 are **not**
produced – they need a standard projection module, which Rceattle does
not have. Projected biomass under the model's own harvest control rule
is in `timeseries` with `era = "fore"`.

## Reference points a fit does not define

A CEATTLE fit leaves a *number* in the reported array for several
reference points it never estimated, so reading the array directly puts
a plausible wrong figure into the one table that becomes the executive
summary. Each is returned as `NA` with the reason in `basis`:

- `Ftarget` / `Flimit` are estimated only under a harvest control rule
  that defines them, and are switched off for a species with no
  projected fishery or with fixed numbers-at-age. Unestimated, they sit
  at their initial value of `exp(0) = 1`, which reads as an F of 1.0/yr.

- `SB0` / `B0` under `msmMode > 0` come from the `MSSB0` / `MSB0`
  inputs, which stand at a placeholder until
  [`fit_mod()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/fit_mod.md)
  derives them from a no-fishing projection. `B_target` and `B_limit`
  are fractions of `SB0` and go with it.

- The per-recruit quantities (`SPR0`, `SPRtarget`, `SPRlimit`) are
  computed only under `msmMode = 0`.

The depletions are **not** blanked alongside `SB0`: under a no-fishing
harvest control rule in multispecies mode the model divides by biomass
in the last projection year, which is the equilibrated unfished
reference, so the series is meaningful there.

## Two objectives

`model` reports both. `marginal_objective` is what the optimizer
minimized — random effects integrated out by the Laplace approximation —
and is what `AIC` is built from. `joint_objective` is what the template
evaluated at the conditional modes, so it is what `likelihood` sums to.
They are equal when `n_random` is 0 and differ by the Laplace correction
otherwise.

## Supplying diagnostics for several models

A diagnostics list is matched to models **by name**, so
`list(alt = ..., base = ...)` pairs correctly whatever the order. An
unnamed list is paired positionally and says so in a message. Names that
are not model names are an error – which catches the realistic mistake
of passing one model's
[`osa_residuals()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/osa_residuals.md)
result stored as a list of parts.

## See also

[`quantity_dictionary()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/quantity_dictionary.md)
for what each quantity means and its units,
[`as.data.frame.Rceattle()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/as.data.frame.Rceattle.md)
for the time series alone, and
[`standard_output()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/standard_output.md)
to relabel the result into the NOAA standardized assessment output that
`stockplotr` and `asar` consume.

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{
fit <- fit_mod(data_list = BS2017SS, estimateMode = 1)
tabs <- report_tables(fit)
tabs$reference_points

# Compare two models, with diagnostics attached
tabs <- report_tables(list(base = fit0, alt = fit1),
                      retro = list(retro0, retro1))
} # }
```
