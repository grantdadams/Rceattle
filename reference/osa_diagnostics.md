# Statistical diagnostics for OSA residuals

Computes the Stewart and Monnahan (2025) statistical diagnostics for a
set of OSA residuals: the standard deviation of the normalized residuals
(SDNR) and the lower/upper tail statistics, each with the 95% interval
expected under the standard normal null hypothesis (so departures can be
judged objectively rather than by eye). Computed per data source (type x
fleet) and overall.

Under a correctly specified model OSA residuals are already iid standard
normal, so the SDNR is simply their sample standard deviation. Its null
interval follows the chi-square result for the sample standard deviation
of `n` standard normals (Francis 2014). Each tail statistic is the
`r`-th order statistic of the residuals, at index `round(p * (n + 1))`,
and its null interval is exact: the `r`-th order statistic of `n`
uniforms is `Beta(r, n - r + 1)`. Nothing is simulated.

## Usage

``` r
osa_diagnostics(osa, nsim = 10000, probs = c(0.025, 0.975), seed = 123)
```

## Arguments

- osa:

  An `rceattle_osa` object from
  [`osa_residuals()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/osa_residuals.md),
  or a data frame with `residual` and (optionally) `type`/`fleet`
  columns.

- nsim:

  Ignored from 5.29.0, when the tail null intervals became exact;
  retained so existing calls keep working, and warns when supplied.

- probs:

  Lower/upper tail probabilities. Default `c(0.025, 0.975)`.

- seed:

  Ignored from 5.29.0, as `nsim` is; the residuals themselves are
  randomized-quantile, so seed
  [`osa_residuals()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/osa_residuals.md)
  instead.

## Value

A data frame (class `"rceattle_osa_diagnostics"`, so it prints as a
compact severity-tagged summary; every column is still there and `$`
works as before) with one row per data source plus an `"all"` row, with
columns: `group` (the `"<source> fleet <n>"` label), `source`, `fleet`,
`n`, `sdnr`, `sdnr_lo`, `sdnr_hi`, `lower`, `lower_lo`, `lower_hi`,
`upper`, `upper_lo`, `upper_hi`, the order statistic each tail was read
at (`lower_r`, `upper_r`) and its exact nominal probability `r/(n + 1)`
(`lower_p`, `upper_p`, which differ from `probs` at small `n`), and the
logical flags `sdnr_ok`, `lower_ok`, `upper_ok` (TRUE when the statistic
is inside its null interval). On the `"all"` row `source` and `fleet`
are `NA`.
