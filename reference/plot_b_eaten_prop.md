# Plot biomass consumed of each prey species by predator

Function that plots the biomass consumed trends as estimated from
Rceattle. Returns and saves a figure with the biomass eaten trajectory.

## Usage

``` r
plot_b_eaten_prop(
  Rceattle,
  file = NULL,
  model_names = NULL,
  line_col = NULL,
  spnames = NULL,
  species = NULL,
  lwd = 3,
  right_adj = 0,
  top_adj = 0.15,
  minyr = NULL,
  mohns = NULL,
  width = 7,
  height = 6.5,
  incl_proj = FALSE,
  incl_mean = FALSE,
  add_ci = FALSE,
  mod_cex = 1,
  maxyr = NULL,
  lty = 1
)
```

## Arguments

- Rceattle:

  A single
  [`fit_mod()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/fit_mod.md)
  object or a list of them (overlaid).

- file:

  Optional file stem; the figure is written to `<file>_<suffix>.png` if
  given.

- model_names:

  Legend labels for the models.

- line_col:

  Line colours; names, hex, or base-graphics integers. `NULL` uses the
  colorblind-safe Okabe-Ito palette. Applied to whichever variable the
  figure separates by colour, in legend order. Too few colours are
  recycled, with a warning.

- spnames:

  Species labels, length `nspp`. Default: the model's own.

- species:

  Species to include, as indices (`c(1, 3)`), names, a logical mask, or
  `"all"`. Default `NULL` plots every species. Species **labels** belong
  in `spnames`; a character `species` that matches no species name is
  read as labels for back-compatibility.

- lwd:

  Line width on the base-graphics scale: the default `3` renders as a
  standard-weight ggplot line. A vector varies it across series.

- right_adj:

  Ignored. Base-graphics leftover: the figure widened its right margin
  to fit the legend. Set margins on the returned ggplot instead.

- top_adj:

  Ignored. Base-graphics leftover; see `right_adj`.

- minyr, maxyr:

  First / last year to plot.

- mohns:

  Ignored. Formerly annotated the figure with Mohn's rho from
  [`retrospective()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/retrospective.md);
  add it with `ggplot2::labs(subtitle = ...)` instead.

- width, height:

  Saved figure size in inches.

- incl_proj:

  Include the projection years, with a dashed divider at the last
  hindcast year.

- incl_mean:

  Add a horizontal line at the hindcast mean of each series.

- add_ci:

  Add a 95% confidence interval. Only available where the plotted
  quantity carries standard errors; warns and draws none otherwise.

- mod_cex:

  Ignored. Base-graphics leftover: legend text size. Use
  `p + ggplot2::theme(legend.text = ggplot2::element_text(size = ...))`.

- lty:

  Line type. A vector varies it across the levels of whatever the figure
  separates by line type.

## Details

Colour separates predators; line type separates models. Panels are prey
species.
