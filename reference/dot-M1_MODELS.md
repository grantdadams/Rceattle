# String\<-\>integer mapping for `M1_model` in [`build_M1()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/build_M1.md)

Either form is accepted by
[`build_M1()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/build_M1.md);
the canonical integer code is what the TMB template ultimately consumes.
The legacy env-driven integer codes 4 and 5 still work with a
deprecation warning – their structural part is identical to 1 and 2
respectively, and the env effect is now expressed via the `linkages`
argument to
[`build_M1()`](https://grantdadams.github.io/Rceattle/reference/build_M1.md)
(see `vignette("environmental-linkages")`). No string alias is offered
for 4 or 5 to discourage their use in new code.

## Usage

``` r
.M1_MODELS
```

## Format

An object of class `integer` of length 4.
