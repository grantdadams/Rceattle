Description: 'Rceattle' is an 'R' package designed to implement the CEATTLE model using Template Model Builder ('TMB'; Kristensen et al. 2015), which can be installed using following https://github.com/kaskr/adcomp/wiki/Download. Rceattle is structured similar to the original manuscript in terms of modularization. Seperate functions estimate retrospective temperature- and size-specific predator rations, prey preference, and weight-at- age. These are then used as inputs to the CEATTLE model to evaluate how predation mortality, recruitment, and survival of three target species change under historical climate conditions and harvest rates.
