/**
 * @file comp_osa.hpp
 * @brief One-step-ahead (OSA) residual helpers for composition data.
 *
 * TMB's oneStepPredict() requires every observation entering the likelihood to
 * live in a flat `obsvec` with a `keep` indicator, and each likelihood term to
 * be multiplied by its keep element. Multinomial and Dirichlet-multinomial
 * composition data are multivariate and discrete, so oneStepPredict cannot use
 * them directly. Following Trijoulet et al. (2023) and WHAM
 * (src/age_comp_osa.hpp), a composition of A bins is decomposed into A-1
 * univariate conditional distributions -- binomials for the multinomial,
 * beta-binomials for the Dirichlet-multinomial -- each gated by its keep
 * element. The final bin is fixed by the sum-to-N constraint and contributes
 * nothing (its residual is not defined and is reported as NA on the R side).
 *
 * Key property: with keep == 1 the sum of the conditional log-densities equals
 * the joint multinomial / Dirichlet-multinomial log-density. Turning OSA on
 * therefore changes how the likelihood is *decomposed*, not its value.
 *
 * These functions are named with an `_osa` suffix and take a data_indicator so
 * they never collide with TMB's built-in dmultinom() or the plain
 * ddirmultinom() in helper_functions.hpp used during ordinary fitting.
 *
 * The file also holds the conditional CDFs oneStepPredict(method = "cdf") asks
 * for -- the continuous binomial for a composition bin, and the normal /
 * left-truncated normal for the aggregate series -- gated by
 * keep.cdf_lower / keep.cdf_upper. Under that method the residual is
 * Phi^-1(F(x)) and no conditional mean is ever formed, so nothing can leave the
 * support of a bounded observation. They are computed only when the caller asks
 * (`do_cdf`, driven by osa_mode == 2), so ordinary fitting and the Gaussian OSA
 * methods pay nothing for them.
